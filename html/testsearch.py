As I understand it, Tg is defined by the temperature where the molecular chains are able to slide past each other. Above which the room temperature Younges modulus  would no longer be valid. The Melting temperature is the point at which the material changes phase from solid to pure liquid (in steady state), at which point you\'d be concerned about fluid mechanics not solid mechanics.Why are you looking for filament materials?

The main reason I was considering running the printer in the garage is due to the emissions, as I figured ABS would be the material of choice. I could run it in the house if I could contain emissions. My initial thoughts were to enclose the printer in an acrylic box and install a circulation fan with activated charcoal filter and let it run for a length of time prior to opening the enclosure after a print. Is this feasible? I could also consider exhaust to outside after print is complete. Does anyone print ABS indoors safely at home, and how?I print ABS at home in my non-enclosed Sigma 2016 printer. I can\'t address the "safely" part, as the odors are minimal. If you plan to enclose your printer, consider that a fan will increase problems with ABS due to thermal irregularities. I\'d suggest leaving a fan off until the print has completed and cooled fully before exhausting the chamber into a filter or outside.I think the optimal solution would be exhausting the enclosure outdoors after print is complete. Closable louver in the front and flexible duct with fan out the back I can seal to the window an shut off while in use. I guess the final thing I would ask is for a printer recommendation. The ones I was thinking about were MakerGear M2, Prusa I3 MK2S, and the Robo R2. Any thoughts?I\'ve assembled a Prusa i3MK2s kit in the recent past, for the public library and it was an excellent experience. The Prusa was easy to build and creates quite good models. As a kit, you would also have the ability to modify it to move the power supply and "brain box" outside the enclosure, assisting in cooling. You can find the assembly instructions on Prusa\'s web site. The project was incredible fun and the printer is cranking out models for the library patrons. Your ducting and fan idea would likely work well, and may need only a minute or two of exhausting to clear the air.', 'answer_score': 0, 'comment_score': 0, 'id': '3dprinting4533', 'categorie':

What resolution are you seeking Layer thickness of 0.100 mm is quite good allowing for ten layers per mm of part thickness with infill adjusted as required If you've already determined that your printer will not print at the resolution required for your gear design you would perhaps purchase a higher resolution printer Of course that may be an expense you would like to avoid If your parts count is small you could consider to print samples of the parts to confirm fit but not worry about strength and then use an online service to have them printed via SLS method Selective Laser Sintering places nylon powder on the work surface then selectively melts the powder into a solid Each layer when completed is covered with another layer of powder and fused to the previous portion or not until the part is complete Because the un-fused powder provides support there is no requirement for the model to have supplemental support structures There is a requirement/objective that the part have drain holes in areas which might otherwise be solid Any surface that entraps powder is charged to the purchaser as if the space within is included in the part An example would be a cube that can be printed as six square faces only The cube wall thickness can be specified and if a drain hole is incorporated the cost would be the volume of the walls only No drain hole would mean the cube would be charged for the entire volume For gears which are typically low profile/flat items that's a minor consideration The same concept applies to SLA printing which uses a laser in a vat of resin If the model is a solid with no drain holes the interior will retain the resin It is possible that the interior can be cured with strong UV light and/or sunlight but opaque resins would not accept this work-around nor would it reduce the cost involved Also note that SLA printed items would lack the necessary strength If farming out your parts is the direction you intend to travel ensure the dimension stability reference in the vendor you use Nylon sintered parts will shrink a known amount during the fusing process The vendor should provide the appropriate reference or the vendor should confirm that he adjusts the model appropriately for shrinkage I have one very tiny part constructed from SLS nylon and it's amazingly strong for such a thin wall Nylon wears well too  If changing the nozzle to a smaller diameter is a viable alternative for your printer then that may give a major increase in your X-Y-resolution You can think of it like drawing with a pencil vs a thick crayon a fine

Your suggestion of a different hot end would be practical or a replacement smaller diameter nozzle. A smaller diameter nozzle has its own complications, but may be the right answer overall.

I do not have a decent soldering iron at the moment, but am in the market for one and this would be a good secondary use for it.I thought I covered both options - making filament and reusing scraps (be they filaments or parts scraps) by melting them into flat plates and them cutting them into jewelry or guitar picks.  IMHO, re-using PLA (unless you are talking LARGE quantities) will always require time and money (it will never be free).

color unless exposed to direct sun heat for prolonged times Obviously use several outer shells If you are making floating thingy and there is a free space in your hull do NOT leave it empty Instead make it solid in the model and set slicer to use sparce hexacomb infill with a solid layer every 20-30 layers This way your model will be made of hundreds of isolated pockets of air so a breach of a hull in some place will not sink it You can also drop lead pellets into those pockets as they are made to weight the ship properly Set nozzle diameter to layer height ratio to more than 3 It will produce nice thick layers welded shut For example use 0.7 nozzle for 0.2 layer or 0.4 nozzle for 0.1 layer The last one can be a bad choice if your extruder can't provide that little flow and tears

have them and will print things for you for a cost Other machines ex Ultimaker 2 Extended will print models up to 30cm along the vertical axis It would require some assembly in the end but you could segment your build and get a boat hull in the end Pros Easily accessible Fairly low cost Maybe under 1000 for the machine vs nearly 1M and many filaments cost 1/10th that of polyjet resins or sintering powders The materials themselves can be UV resistant and salt water resistant Cons Joinery and seams create passageways for water ingress so you'd need secondary sealant The FDM process itself isn't always watertight so you'd need sealant anyway Low interlayer adhesion limits the tensile strength along one axis and the shear strength in one plane so you'd either need composite hull

Realistically, you would be far better off with a composite hull. Use an FDM assembly and layer matrix reinforced fibers on the inside and outside. Strong, light, and relatively inexpensive.", 'answer_score': 12, 'comment_score': 0, 'id': '3dprinting3521', 'categorie': '3dprinting', 'title': '3D printing a boat hull', 'tags': '', 'body': ' I am wondering if it would it be feasible at an affordable price to 3D print a boat hull small dimensions maybe something like 60x40x20 cm I am mostly concerned about durability against salty water UV rays extreme temperatures under the sun or in a cold ocean strength the material should be able to resist some chocs and maybe a little bit of pressure if a wave was to smash on it waterproofness Those characteristics should last during extended periods of time in water at least several months maybe more about a year or two Is there any easily accessible 3D printing material that would match those characteristics ', 'viewcount': 411, 'score': 2, 'creation_date': '2017-02-03T20:36:47.677', 'link': '3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3521/3D-printing-a-boat-hull'}}, {'_index': 'test', '_type': 'document', '_id': '3dprinting3922', '_score': 5.0504727, '_source': {'answers': '', 'comments': "I've read that lemon juice can be used if limonene isn't available.

It smells citrus-y and no toxins appeared to be created. No bubbling either. It completely dissolved the HIPS and most of the ABS part too!
