It can be quite fiddly to get working correctly, leveling a printer manually is not that hard and saves your Z-axis rods from wear. Of course, if your printer is built very sloppily and falls out of calibration as soon as you look at it, auto-leveling will be much more useful, but with a solidly built printer you level once and forget about it."

The more steps, the more positions you can achieve.  Similarly, servos benefit from more poles as that makes them run smoother.  Thus both schemes typically use the same motors.

Ive assembled ikea furniture before, so im comfortable with electronics lol. I like to build quadcopters and found that a 3d printer would possibly come in handy for parts. I can also follow instructions and tutorials. I would like something that i can download thingiverse files to and print out for me. And possibly in the future something that i can create something with cad (or other types of 3d printing software) and then print" CreationDate="2017-08-20T16:21:08.233" UserId="8147" />

Multiply that by a fudge factor,  see where it leads you.

The main reason I was considering running the printer in the garage is due to the emissions, as I figured ABS would be the material of choice. I could run it in the house if I could contain emissions. My initial thoughts were to enclose the printer in an acrylic box and install a circulation fan with activated charcoal filter and let it run for a length of time prior to opening the enclosure after a print. Is this feasible? I could also consider exhaust to outside after print is complete. Does anyone print ABS indoors safely at home, and how?" CreationDate="2017-08-23T11:20:26.520" UserId="8191" />
