        "answers": " Almost all 3D printers have issues that could cause health problems FDM/FFF printers heat plastic to a temperature that may cause it to off-gas and these byproducts may not be healthy SLA printers often use epoxies that may off-gas or may be somewhat toxic prior to being cured Powder based printers can also off-gas in addition to the powder itself presenting a possible hazard Many hobbyist and small companies dance around the problem and suggest that the machines always be used in well ventillated areas Professional machines often have filters and ventillation systems built in Rather than trying to find a perfectly safe 3D printer spend some time deciding what you want to use one for find printers suitable for your use and expect that you'll need to provide reasonable ventilation for almost any printer Plan your installation for that and you should be able to make any printer safe for your required use If however you plan on setting up a printer farm with many printers and plan to have yourself or others spend significant time operating them I suggest you work with a health and safety professional and have them identify possible hazards and plan mitigation  There is very little information about safety available as home 3D printers are relatively new However plastics such as ABS have a long history in making plastic products and a study found that at traditional manufacturing methods such as injection molding and hot wire cutting do not release dangerous levels of carcinogens and/or respiratory sensitizers in to the air Of course 3D printers are not among the processes covered in the study In home 3D printing circles this study that looks at ultrafine particle UFP emissions is often cited It finds that printing ABS releases relatively high levels of UFP's and PLA releases significantly fewer but still quite a large amount However it is unclear whether/how dangerous these UFP's are in the amounts emitted It is often suggested that PLA partly because of the reduced UFP emissions is safer to print than ABS partly because of its natural origins as it can be derived from materials such as cornstarch I would caution against this line of reasoning since natural materials can still be poisonous snake venom is natural after all and the cornstarch is heavily processed so it hardly resembles its original form The lower UFP emissions may suggest it is safer but the study is only quantitative not qualitative That said PLA does probably pose less of a risk despite my earlier argumentation against natural materials PLA does play quite nicely with the human body but I contend the risk with ABS is not too large anyways given that it has been safely used in factories for decades Another study is often miscited supposedly saying that 3D printing ABS releases hydrogen cyanide The study only looks at the thermal decomposition of ABS which happens at significantly higher temperatures than are reached during printing but a significantly malfunctioning printer might cause toxic gasses to be released but I contend that at that point you should worry about your printer being on fire rather than temporary exposure to some toxins There are no printers out there that are fundamentally safer than others However some printers have an enclosure containing the fumes and some even have a carbon filter and a fan for fume extraction If you would like to err on the side of caution this might be a good choice but again it is not clear if a carbon filter is totally effective Finally as printers are generally quite noisy it tends to be preferrable to keep your printer in a separate room from where you usually work In this case fume exposure during the few minutes that you go to check on your print is minimal and the potential advantages of a safer printers or using safer materials diminish Incidental exposure as a hobbyist is probably not a big deal workers in factories are exposed to the fumes of melted plastic their entire lives and they don't seem to be dropping dead On the other hand if you are going to be printing structurally then it is probably preferable to move your printer to a separate room if not because of health and safety because of the noise  Apart from the inherent process itself and direct health hazards from that many 3D printers also require some complementary technology to work fdm printers have a printing head that needs to move around in 3D space Moving machinery parts can be a hazard In a home/hobbyist environment with children for example I would recommend to buy a printer with a housing open designs often feature bare electronics mounted directly to the printer structure This rises the possibility of short circuits and electric shock The printers that heat material often do so at very high temperatures Hot parts of the printer should not be touched  I am going to address the air issue as it is currently unresolved the third dimension offers a great answer for common safety issues The short answer is that based on our limited knowledge at this point there may be imperceptible health hazards related to FDM FFF printers and therefore additional safety precautions are in my opinion necessary and not optional or secondary as suggested by some in the community In other words if you can isolate your printer in a well-vented area where people rarely go then of course it's not a health risk but if people will be exposed to the air of the printer for any significant periods of time you need to do something about it This is my situation where I live dedicated workshops and extra rooms are luxuries that most people do not have Realistic Chance of Being Dangerous Treat It As Dangerous The key information at this point in time is the UFP Ultra-Fine Particle study that is linked in Tom's answer Leaving out the scary detailed parts Therefore results herein suggest that caution should be used when operating these 3D printing instruments inside unvented or unfiltered indoor environments due to their large emissions of UFPs One important limitation to this study is that we have no information about the chemical constituents of the UFPs emitted from either type of 3D printer there may also be differences in toxicity because of differences in chemical composition This means that although many processes release UFPs the authors of the paper compare to cooking all UFPs are not created equal Since the UFPs from 3D printing are still an unknown the only real answer from a safety perspective is to treat them as dangerous This is not legal safety or professional advice I am not qualified to give an opinion on what should be done but I will share what I would do Venting Active airflow pushing the envelope of air around the print into a large unpopulated body of air Enclosure Venting By fully enclosing your printer it will probably keep the UFPs mostly within the enclosure You could combine that with either continuous venting or as some have suggested purge venting before opening the enclosure Enclosure Filtering A filter can be applied both to the vent to reduce the output of UFPs e.g if you have no access to a safe body of air and as a recirculating system that removes the UFPs from the body of air within the enclosure A note on positive vs negative pressure related to venting and filtering if you produce positive pressure within the enclosure you are going to be blowing all the UFPs out into your environment anyway Negative pressure vented to a safe body of air or neutral pressure with good seals and recirculated filtering may avoid that A note on filters Activated carbon filters will not remove UFPs HEPA filters may remove 3D printing UFPs Which Printer As long as the uncertainty exists I predict that as the market matures filtering and enclosures will become more standard At this point in time the only enclosed AND HEPA filtered consumer-grade FDM printers I am aware of are the Up Box and the Zortrax Inventure There are a number of enclosed printers without filtering As an alternative at least one company has appeared with products targeted at those who are concerned about various safety aspects of 3d printing ",

        "answers": " As with any manufacturing process you'll need to learn to use the right tool for the job It depends on the requirements of the part To answer your question I would suggest using a larger layer height for the sheer fact of reducing print time on larger objects However it depends on the part and how small the details are on the part If your part has sharp edges that are required for the proper functionality of the part then you'll want to use a smaller layer height Or if your part fits into another part you'll probably want to use a smaller layer height Another variable might be whether or not post-processing is necessary Is this part going to be purposefully printed larger/rougher with the idea to use a Dremel later to smooth everything out If yes then use a larger layer height  I believe the Slic3r Manual summarizes this quite nicely A thicker layer height will provide more flow and consequently more heat making the extrusion adhere to the bed more It also gives the benefit of giving more tolerance for the levelness of the bed It is recommended to raise the first layer height to match the diameter of the nozzle e.g a first layer height of 0.35mm for a 0.35mm nozzle In other words larger layer heights for the first layer typically gives better adhesion and makes inaccurate bed leveling and auto leveling still work  In short no Smaller layers will make your prints look nicer That said in my experience most printers can handle roughly the same layer heights no matter what the manufacturer says it can do With a little tinkering you can get any printer to do what you tell it to do That said for larger prints you really won't want to lower the layer height too much Typically the quality difference you see in a print that's say 2 mm layer height typical vs 1mm layer height typically high quality is not that much different Note that lowering your layer height increases the number of layers in your object so it'll take longer to print and have more opportunities to fail along the way For anything of significant size 150 mm or so it's really not worth the extra risk I'd say ",

        "answers": " I\"m no expert on this but the article at https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_metal may be relevant for you There are some special alloys such as gold/silicon and various titanium-based ones that become bulk metal glasses if cooled extremely quickly for example by sputtering onto a spinning cold surface The speed of cooling prevents crystal formation Early BMGs were quite strong but brittle improvements have reduced brittleness and required cooling speed  I think the closest you're going to get is with a composite material Over the last 2 years or so there have been more and more composite filaments emerging on the market for consumer 3D printers I good example of composite filaments can be seen on Proto-Pasta Since the filament must mostly be comprised of the polymer binder the material will obviously not exhibit all the properties of both Without getting into too much Material Science consider the composite of both ABS and Iron or some other ferrous-based metal You cannot expect to print a solid circuit out of the filament because the iron may not be represented throughout all directions of the filament therefore resulting in resistance or flat out non-conductivity So to answer your question I'm not aware of a significantly larger glass state in a type of metal/alloy Your best bet is a composite but it depends on the requirements for your part if a composite will work Then you'll have another battle of finding the right type of composite and worst of all a good supplier lol  I spent some time looking at making an FDM machine that would print bronze filament An alloy commonly made into wire had a difference between the solidus and liquidus temperature of only 50 degrees C I determined that one could make a conventional hot end electrically heated made of either molybdenum or tungsten I did not determine how the bronze would behave in the 50 degree solid-to-liquid zone I was more concerned about the solubility of the nozzle material in copper for which I could find very little published data From my experience welding and from printing plastics with FDM there could be a problem with layer adhesion To really bond the cooled material needs to be melted by the material being deposited in the next layer This is complicated by the temperature of the cooled material the thermal conductivity of the material and the propensity of the material to form oxides These could be mitigated by heating the object in an inert atmosphere So to answer the question I would suggest looking at bronze alloys because they melt at moderate temperatures and are less prone to oxidation than aluminum alloys  A few things are required for effective extrusion-style 3d printing materials It must stay where placed by the nozzle long enough to harden or alternately for pastes and such have a shear-thinning or thixotropic viscous profile so it will not flow under its own weight If using a filament extruder it must have a wide range of viscosity that varies gradually over a considerable temperature range This is necessary to develop the proper cap zone semi-melt shearing behavior that allows the incoming filament to act like a piston and generate pressure upstream of the nozzle Pellet extruders have a similar requirement but related to screw/wall shearing rather than filament/wall shearing If using neither filament nor pellets such as clay printers the material must be pumpable by a positive-displacement pump It is possible to pump molten metal but the cost is quite high It must form some kind of bond with previously-deposited solid material without needing to be in a state that will rapidly flow and lose shape It must have some combination of low shrinkage the ability to creep at the printer's ambient temp and/or low stiffness that allows consecutive layers to be stacked without an unacceptable amount of warping Liquid metals tend to have a conflict between Staying where you put it and bonding with the previous layer In order for deposited metal to fully bond the interface material needs to reach the melting point so a true fusion weld occurs And in order to supply enough heat to remelt the interface without an additional heat source like an arc the deposited molten metal needs to be very hot So it will tend to run while it cools High density and high heat capacity makes it run fast and cool slowly Pretty much every DIY metal 3d print such as made by wire-feed MIG welders ends up looking something like this https 3dprint.com/29944/diy-metal-printing-garage In comparison polymers have long molecular chains that allow them to diffusion weld and adhere WITHOUT fully remelting the interface Molten liquid plastic will stick to solid plastic quite effectively The interface only needs to get hot enough for appreciable diffusion to intertwine the molecular chains This will occur between the glass point and melting point without true fusion occurring So you can print molten plastic at a temperature where it will stay in place long enough to harden and still get good bonding Metals also tend to be very stiff which encourages warping It is difficult to build a heated environment of sufficient temperature to properly stress-relieve the thermal contraction stress as the print progresses whereas with plastic a heated build plate and warm enclosure can permit warping stresses to start relaxing as the print progresses It is possible to FDM-style 3d print filament/wire made of metal alloys that have a wide range between solidus and liquidus It has been done using solder and similar alloys However between the warping stresses poor layer bonding from inadequate interface re-melting and use of soft low-melting alloys the resulting printed parts will usually end up being weaker than if they had simply been printed in a strong plastic For example PEEK is nearly as strong as aluminum and carbon fiber or fiberglass composite plastics can exceed metals on various performance metrics So what's the point of printing with weak brittle metal alloys Over the years lots of people have tried FDM-style metal printing but no one has found it worthwhile to pursue in the long run More typical DIY metal printing approaches like 3D MIG welding following by cleanup machining will produce better results ",

        "answers": " Paraphrasing this site Feel free to add suggestions in the form of comments and I will try to incorporate them Summary ABS Stronger machinable more flexible and more temperature resistant than PLA Typically printed on a heated bed Warping is a common problem when printing ABS PLA Wider range of filaments available easier and in some cases faster to print Not as strong as ABS and the fact that its biodegradable could be seen as both a benefit and a drawback Material Properties ABS Strong plastic with mild flexibility Naturally beige in color Can be filled and sanded Higher temperature Easy to recycle PLA Not as strong as ABS but more rigid Naturally transparent More difficult to fill and sand Can sag in hot temperatures Sourced from organic matter so it can be broken down in commercial compost facilities Part Accuracy ABS Part warping is a significant issue Sharp corners will often be rounded PLA Less heat required contributes to less warping Becomes more liquid at common extruder temperatures so finer details can be printed Safety and Handling ABS Strong burning/melting plastic smell is present when printing ABS Health concerns have been raised regarding airborne ultrafine particles generated while printing with ABS ref ABS will absorb moisture causing popping when the moisture enters the hot end This leads to discontinuities in the print job PLA Doesn't smell as strongly when printing due to its organic nature Moisture can also be absorbed into PLA and can irreversibly damage it  The problem is that it's almost impossible to answer the PLA/ABS question just by looking at the material characteristics as it is so dependent on the application and even the specific object you're printing The decision guide in this infographic covers the following points that usually should be involved when deciding between ABS and PLA Ventilation I wouldn't recommend putting your nose into the printer with any material but being exposed to ABS fumes is likely a lot worse Heated Bed This is an easy one Without one PLA should be your choice If you do have one though it might improve adhesion of PLA as well set to 60C instead of 90C-110C for ABS Exposure to Heat or Mechanical Stress ABS would be the preferred choice as PLA melts at lower temperatures it might start to deform when left in your car in the summer and ABS can endure more bend before breaking Of course even ABS has upper limits and you might want to consider other materials like Polycarbonate for extreme applications On the other hand there are newer materials that share many PLA features biodegradable no heat bed required but are more similar to ABS in their mechanical properties e.g BioFila Linen and temperature stability e.g Advanced PLA ExcelFil EVO Printer Enclosure Not a must-have for using ABS but especially objects with large footprints are susceptible to warping when they cool too fast A fully enclosed printer ensures a slow and even cooling process Post Processing Often an afterthought but ABS has a slight advantage here as it is a little easier to sand and you have the option of working with acetone which I personally wouldn't mess with unless you REALLY need to Print Temperature Roughly 190C-220C for PLA and 220C-240C for ABS so be sure that your printer can go high enough to extrude ABS Biodegradability PLA is biodegradable under specific circumstances which is a consideration when printing test objects prototypes and other objects that will be discarded  PLA polylactic acid melts at a lower temp and does not warp AS BADLY when cooled It is non-toxic in USA it comes from cornstarch beets in some countries or tapioca root It is less flexible than ABS could rip or crumble ABS Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene is a harder and more sturdy plastic What Legos are made of A heated bed is used to keep it from cooling too fast as warping can be a problem is you cool it too fast being close to an exterior door or an air vent An enclosed printer helps regulate temp and avoids SOME of this problem Some people get headaches from the smell of molten ABS over a prolonged time It flexes better than PLA Can be sanded or cut easily and maintain integrity Beware of CHEAP ABS as it may contain a higher amount of HCN Hydrogen Cyanide that can be released when used but usually around 1 part per million about one fourth the dangerous limit GOOD ABS CAN contain HCN as well but it is not released by normal printing temperatures avoid burning ABS or Nylon so all in all PLA is safe/non-toxic biodegradable uses less energy to print less flexible ABS is harder sturdier will last nearly forever if not bent or stressed or frozen Somewhat flexible and will snap back  PLA/ABS general and thermal properties  Basic facts and tips for using and choosing ABS and PLA materials Made from ABS Petroleum based PLA Corn or other plants Smell ABS smell of hot plastic PLA gives off a smell similar to a semi-sweet cooking oil Less intense smell than ABS Part Accuracy Both PLA and ABS are capable of building dimensionally accurate parts However there are characteristics that we need to memorized ABS will be curling upwards of the surface in direct contact with the 3D printer\u2019s print bed for fine and delicate features on parts involving sharp corners such as gears there will often be a slight rounding of the corner PLA much less part warping but it undergoes more of a phase-change when heated and becomes much more liquid The increased flow can also lead to stronger binding between layer Recycling ABS Recycling number 7 most local recycling programs do not accept ABS It generally being recycled into plastic lumber PLA it biodegrades however the process takes a long time when outside of an industrial composting facility Why we provide a vacuum sealed package for ABS and PLA products long term exposure to a humid environment without sealed package may result in detrimental effects both to the printing process and to the quality of finished parts ABS will tend to bubble and spurt from the tip of the nozzle when printing part accuracy strength are reduced Raises the risk of clogging the

        "answers": " The most obvious solution is to pause the print and swap filament for another color Another option is to splice pieces of filament together though this does not allow very precise control of when the switch happens There is also a device that can automatically slice filament this way Finally another option that uses very little external equipment is to use permanent markers to colorize light-colored filament Other options include upgrading to a printer with more hotends or installing a hotend with multiple filament inputs and one outputs but these options would involve significantly changing your printer setup  I've seen where certain slicers and/or firmware installations will allow you to set pauses mid-print so you can insert a different filament and resume Such firmware that I'm aware of is Sailfish I haven't personally used this but I've heard many great things for people who enjoy tinkering with their machine(s Alternatively there are 3D-printable attachments for your extruder that allow you setup markers to color your filament mentioned by Tom in another answer  Another approach is Mosaic Manufacturing's Palette it appears to a single extruder 3D printer as a filament reel but it is creating a custom filament on-the-fly by pulling information from a multi-extruder gcode file to determine the length and the order each color segment needs to be The device was a successful Kickstarter campaign and as far as I can tell it isn't shipping yet as of January 2016 but they are taking orders and promising an April 2016 ship date  Answering this question fully depends on the type of printer you have Some printers have a pause capability while others do not Some have multiple extruders while most do not Some have a tube leading to the extruder and others do not You specifically are asking about dealing with more than two colors when you have a dual-extruder but the question generalizes to how to get more colors than you have extruders Markers probably offer the easiest solution You could have different markers on the feeds for each extruder For printers with no pause ability you might have to snip one filament and hand feed the second color after the first one until it can be caught by the feeder gear There are rigs that are available or that you can make that will let you connect two strands together lengthwise You can then make up a single piece of filament that has multiple colors Thus one extruder head will be generating multiple colors The Kickstarter mentioned elsewhere essentially does this automatically for several strands whose lengths are calculated precisely by special software The result is a single strand of filament that goes into one of your extruders the other extruder would be unused with this solution  The standard option is to change out filaments at certain times during the print Software to add these pauses to your print automatically are around with one ColorPrint This method works if you only want to change at a certain Z height and not intermix colors on the same levels The other newer development that works for many printers this works for single nozzle printers as well are getting Y type adapters that allow more than 1 filament to be fed into a single extruder and use a rapid retraction to pull the filament back out past the Y connector to allow the next color to be fed into the nozzle Several companies are putting products like this out on the market at this time An example of this can be seen at this page As mentioned in other answers Mosaic Pallette is an option to drive more complicated multi-color prints but is a rather expensive option at 999 The E3d Kraken might be a possible hotend upgrade to a Makerbot although it would involve a fair amount of work ",

        "answers": " The biggest effect I've see on resolution is due to plastic stress due to thermal gradients The higher resolution prints build up more layers of material and each layer has a cumulative effect on thermal stress The upper layers pulling up more as they cool and the lower layers curling up more strongly as the layer count is increased To counteract this a heated or even just a draft free enclosure makes a big difference Having a heated print bed helps significantly as long as the bed itself resists deformation a sheet metal or PCB bed will bend more than glass under the same tension for instance The actual plastic strength however appears increased Laying down thinner layers of material appears to increase the bond strength between layers  Regarding the sturdiness of the final print I believe it depends on the inter-layer adhesion of the filament itself which varies greatly Also normally thicker layers would increase the strength of the print up to a certain point An informal study of strength/layer height ratio can be found here this study suggests that the strength of the print increases up to a layer height of 0.25 mm and then stabilizes On the other hand printing at high resolution often will hide defects that occur from bad quality filament in particular filament that has degraded by absorbing too much moisture Due to the less amount of plastic extruded per layer at high resolutions some general printing defects also tend to be less pronounced and easier handle afterwards  In my experience building with smaller layers also makes bridging and overhangs more pronounced and less likely to fail The smaller layers allow gradual changes for overhangs that are more abrupt with thicker layer  It's also worth noting that the ratio of nozzle diameter to layer height affects strength The layer height is typically set slightly smaller than the nozzle diameter so the nozzle squeezes the new plastic onto the previous layer This is especially important for the first layer because it affects how well the object sticks to the bed but it also affects inter-layer strength ",

        "answers": " If you'd like to print on RepRap like FDM printers you cannot print from metal but you can use some filament that tries to look like metal I have good experience with Bronzefill but there are plenty of others just Google for metal filament 3d printing If you actually want to print from metal you would need SLS Selective laser sintering printer which is much more expensive  parts I don't want to feel like a plastic This is harder than looking like metal Plastic doesn't have nearly the density of metal nor the thermal conductivity of metal So by touch people will be able to tell the difference between almost any metal item and a plastic item that looks similar For jewelry as long as the wearer doesn't mind that it's not metal they will be able to tell you can fool most viewers with proper finishing Sanding/smoothing and then painting the printed part will work for most things For things which dangle significantly the swinging and action of the item may give away its density but some objects people expect to be hollow metal can be printed in solid or high density plastic and give the same weight though they are lower density Are there any specific type of home-printers that can achieve that For things which feel metallic no except for very small items where the weight and thermal conductivity won't be significant A laser sintering printer could make real metal parts if this is needed but these don't fall into the category of home machines If you don't mind a multi step process you can make molds of the printed object then cast real metal or very high density epoxies to accomplish your goal Beyond that a high resolution machine with a lot of hand-finishing work is going to get you as close as you'll get to looking like metal  The Colorfabb metal filaments are the most metal-like filaments I've used copper brass and bronze and probably the ones that would make the most sense for jewelry While not as dense as solid metal it's about 3 times as dense as regular plastic and when polished the metal shows through Print at 100 infill to make it heavier Bronzefill is about 3.9g/cm\u00b3 about 80 metal by weight maybe 30-40 by volume I wouldn't say the polished result feel like solid metal but it feels even less like plastic There's also Filamet which promises to be almost entirely made of metal and can be sintered into solid metal but it hasn't been released yet  In addition to the aforementioned enriched filaments which give an excellent result ABS can be plastered painted and even chrome plated  Especially for smaller parts I would suggest looking into electroplating You can get a really nice copper nickel or even gold finish using it The biggest issue is that to electroplate something it must be conductive but there are many conductive paints on the market which you can use to apply a very light coating to make the plastic conductive I heavily suggest priming well 2-3 coats before applying the conductive paint as it will help to minimize the amount of conductive paint needed Here is an instructables link on a cheap diy electroplating solution It's assuming you are doing it on a metal but once you apply the conductive paint it's effectively the same thing Also here is an amazon link to a fairly well priced conductive spray paint which would do the job just fine  There's also an interesting discussion of printing with specially-designed solder alloys at http blog.reprap.org/2011/06/new-approach-to-printing-metals.html The author settled on 57.5%Sn 41.3%Bi 1.2 In which begins to melt at 130 and finishes by about 170 This has much better viscosity after melting so it doesn't just drip away or bead up and whose melting point is low enough that it can be applied directly on top of PLA or ABS Brass nozzles corrode quickly however so another material is needed anodized Al was an improvement It sounds difficult but feasible  You have several options 1 Printing with filaments made up of plastic and metal powder mix Bronzefill is one example http colorfabb.com/bronzefill While most may argue it doesn't look much like bronze or copper and rather clay it can made to by some automatic polishing methods https www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU8WvGveNj4 https www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDoYO22103Q Some don't like the idea of having a plastic and metal powder mixture and they say if it's not pure bronze/some other alloy it might as well be painted Which is the second option 2 Spray painting an ABS or PLA print with metal color spray paint You might need to sand or acetone bath the print first for the paint to be applied evenly 3 Metal plating can be done for more realstic texture https www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PnlZ4MTfCk The 3d print should again be sanded/polished first 4 The first method of getting actual metal object from a plastic object Printing with a metal clay then firing it in a kiln You'll need an appropriate extruder which can extrude paste instead of filament http www.thingiverse.com/search?q=metal+clay+extruder&amp;sa There are 3d printers that can do that officially https www.minimetalmaker.com You'll need a kiln 5 Second method of getting actual metal object from a plastic object via metal casting lost polymer casting From all the above options this is the most dangerous if you're not experienced skilled and careful https

        "answers": " The solution I prefer to prevent ABS withdrawal is using Blue tape on the bed and then spread a thin layer of Polyvinyl acetate Vinavil glue If your printer allows it you can also print with the bed at 110\u00b0C  This is a common problem with ABS You might prevent it by enclosing the printer inside a box/chamber that will create a warmer environment and the extruded material will cool down more slowly hence not creating such a tension Other option is to use PLA instead if possible the problem is not so significant with PLA  Adding a manually added brim with a larger bulk at the corner extremities that you can cut off after printing should help My larger prints come off the printer looking like tents with concrete weights tied to their corners The weights are attached to the print by very short a 2-3 layer depending on print size brim-like strip that makes them easy to remove using side cutters The weights are usually enough to hold the corners of my target print on the plate in conjuction with a weak slurry  Most common problem with corners is to low temperature of heated bed Set the heated bed temperature to 110 If this will not help then try to set brim in your slicer The problem can be cause by other issues You can find additional tips in following Troubleshooting Guides overheating simplify3d Print Quality Troubleshooting Guide differential cooling of printed object reprap.org Print Troubleshooting Pictorial Guide warping A visual Ultimaker troubleshooting guide warping all3dp.com 16 Common 3D Printing Problems  There are many different approaches to solving this issue and most of the answers already are spot-on However the fundamental reason for the warping is incorrect and inconsistent temperature across the material If there is too much fluctuation in the temperature across the object in this heated state can result in warping The reason you see this mostly on the build plate is because the temperature of the first few layers of molten plastic vary much more against the build plate than against higher layers Note that you can see additional warping mid-print using ABS and this can be a result of a draft or sudden drop in ambient temperature So to help solve your problem here are some suggestions sorry if there are duplicates Completely enclose/seal your machine's build area to reduce or eliminate if possible draft and prevent the natural heat of the machine from escaping Increase the temperature on your build plate I almost exclusively use ABS on my printer and I keep my HBP at about 112C However I live in the NW of the US so my climate is naturally cooler than say Florida Alternatively try decreasing the nozzle temperature to a lower point within the ABS melting range This will just shorten the gap between the inconsistencies in temperature across layers It is typically better to print at lower temperatures if you can help it Obviously there are differences in the filament so you'll have to find that sweet spot Ensure your build plate is flat and your tape doesn't have bubbles Your BP being flat should be a no brainer but if your kapton tape or whatever you use has bubbles your freshly printed plastic may not be getting the same temperature from the BP as the rest of your part This is a bad thing as mentioned earlier Use extra adhesion techniques such as ABS Glue ABS w acetone or even hairspray This works about 80 of the time for me but can make it a bit difficult when removing the parts off the BP  I would recommend using a raft on your print A raft is a few layers that are printed on the bed before your print starts The larger you make the raft the stronger the center of it will be The edges may warp but the inside where your print is will be fine Using a raft that is mainly comprised of lines instead of solid surfaces would allow a smaller chance of warping as it could only warp with the lines  I think you answered your question in your statement Lulzbot and ABS Lulz does not have an enclosure Try using PLA for an open air system Or build an enclosure Following you can add glue or hairspray But I promise you with any open air printer you will face this problem I only use ABS on my FFCPs Even with their passive heat chambers I plan to move to PLA for all my printers  To answer the specific question of why the corners lift off it seems it has to do with the thermal expansion or shrinkage and surface adhesion area The material is deposited hot and even after it cools is still warm and as it cools it apparently shrinks in size slightly Each layer therefore produces a little bit of force pulling upwards and towards the center of the layer as the layer shrinks So each layer is actually in a state of slightly tensile stress Over a few layers this may not cause a noticeable effect but as more layers are added the total force pulling on the bottom layer increases The reason this affects corners more than the bulk surface regions is that the total surface area holding the part to the bed is smaller at sharper corners so less force is required there to overcome the bed-adhesion force causing corners to unstick eventually Since this is an artifact of thermal expansion attempting to maintain a uniform temperature across the print volume/printed part will probably help a lot for example by enclosing the printer as others have said In addition to the prior suggestions the following paper suggests that chamfering rounding the corners can help with this if your design allows for that D D Hernandez Factors Affecting Dimensional Precision of Consumer 3D Printing Intl Jnl Aviation Aeronautics and Aerospace 2015 If the bottom layer does not appropriately adhere to the print bed the cooling process and material shrinkage in layers above it will tend to pull at the smallest features with the least surface area in contact with the bed causing sections of the print to warp Sharp corners at the bottom of the print pose a particular problem Side-thought I wonder if varying the bed temperature during the print for example slowly decreasing it to room-temp as more layers are printed would help since a constant bed-temp would theoretically produce a vertical temp-gradient for a very tall part Don't think I've seen anyone try that presumably because Cura doesn't automatically insert those g-code commands for us Wouldn't be too hard to insert custom bed-temp commands throughout the g-code file though but would take longer to temp-stabilize between layers  Another approach is to put mouse ears on all the corner parts that you clip off the print afterward https www.makerbot.com/media-center/2011/02/25/mouse-ears-defeat-corner-curling-monster  In answer to the question why do the corners lift when using ABS the answer has to do with the coefficient of thermal expansion or contraction ABS compared to PLA has a higher coefficient meaning that as the temperature of you part changes the more the part will deform With 3d printing the material extruded from the nozzle is quite a bit higher than the build chamber As the layers print and the extruder moves up the lowest layers are cooler than the layers above shrinking as time goes on For angular parts this is a larger problem than for round parts With angular parts parts with sharp edges in X and Y axis as they cool the internal stresses induced by cooling increase and can't be resolved in just the xy axis and cannot move into the build plate The part then lifts up to reduce these stresses A brim or raft is a thin layer that ideally cools at a constant rate through out which will effectively increase the bonding of your part to the build plate Abs to abs bonding being stronger than abs bonding to whatever your build plate material surface is For most parts this is sufficient to keep good adhesion while your part builds and cools Raises the temperature of the build plate also reduced the stress in the brim/raft by reducing the difference in temperature This is why those are the go-to solutions for stopping abs from lifting If your part is large enough or the angles are quite sharp in XY think of a five pointed star for example Then the brim raft won't necessarily be enough to prevent the warping That's where helper discs mouse ears etc Are helpful These when dispersed around the outer sharp corners increase the surface area of the raft and also reduce the angles of the thermal contraction due to cooling Note that while I'm talking about ABS specifically this will apply to any and all materials if the part geometry or material properties have the same issues Nylon for example is also a pain to print for similar reasons The final thing to say is that all if this is for nothing if your build plate isn't both flat and level ",
        "comments": "As mentioned in the question I have used ABS slurry to keep the part attached to the Kapton tape on the bed and the pulling up was so strong that it peeled the tape off the bed I guess I'm looking more for reasons the part is pulling up in the first place.Blue tape is not Kapton tape It is a masking tape with heat resistance.Doesn't TAZ 5 have PEI tape?I have enclosed the whole printer in a foam oven It gets quite warm inside.Correct sorry I was just using Kapton at work so I had that on my mind.What fill percentage are you using Adjusting the fill percentage of the print should alter the rate of cooling and therefore the stresses generated by the temperature differences as you print.50 I guess the same could be said about slowing the print down 50 is quite high I often use 10-15 and the print is still very sturdy even with a single shell.and the problem still exists?",

        "answers": " There are a few main safety precautions you should consider Make sure the area is well-ventilated Acetone is flammable A buildup of acetone gas could quickly get concentrated meaning that a single spark could lead to disaster Using a fan is good angle it towards an open window This is also to prevent exposure to acetone because of its toxicity Be prepared to fight a fire Should vapor ignite you may need to fight the fire If it is large enough then you should clearly evacuate the area If it appears to be small use dry chemical powder to snuff out the fire Alcohol foam water spray and/or fog may be used on slightly larger fires Acetone is not likely to cause a large inferno to rip through the building But there's always the chance of a small fire Be careful Create a vapor chamber This is another way to stop a potential fire from spreading It can also reduce contamination Wear gloves This can minimize any potential transfer toxic effects However skin exposure is unlikely to cause major issues Acetone is toxic as I mentioned before but it is not highly toxic Exposure via the eyes and nose/mouth is the main risk Skin effects may occur e.g mild irritation but they are minor and generally arise only after long-term exposure hence the recommendation of gloves in some cases Acetone exposure is only a serious problem when a person is repeatedly exposed to levels greater than 1,000 ppm severe effects only arise at much higher levels It seems unlikely given a proper ventilation system that this will be an issue In addition to all this basic safety precautions such as wearing a ventilator mask and goggles should definitely be taken When working with any such chemicals with the potential for bodily harm these should absolutely be used  No fire Acetone is highly flammable Avoid open flame smoking soldering etc near acetone or acetone fumes Be ready to fight a fire Ventilate Acetone is very volatile so the fumes will be everywhere in the room While bathing them should not kill you it is certainly not good for your health It may cause drowsiness or dizziness It is also a good idea to close the container/jar as soon as possible and do not keep it open when not necesery Avoid eye contact Acetone causes serious eye irritation IF IN EYES Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes Remove contact lenses if present and easy to do continue rinsing Seek medical help if needed You should also avoid skin contact repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking but this never happens me if I wash my hand after using acetone  Contrary to what the other answers suggest the risk of fire is not that great An acetone explosion is even more unlikely since you need a ratio of 2.5 12.8 acetone vapor to air for that too much acetone as would be the case inside of your smoothing vessel and nothing happens too little as would be the case inside of a badly ventilated room and nothing happens either Note that even if you were working in a completely non-ventilated ridiculously small 1m^3 room you'd still need to evaporate over half a liter of liquid acetone to reach that bare minimum 2.5 In any case well before you got into the danger zone the air would become unbreathable So then what should you be mindful of when using acetone It can give you a headache Avoid breathing the fumes and ensure adequate ventilation You may opt to use gloves as skin contact should be avoided acetone can irritate the skin and possibly be absorbed through the skin However limited skin contact isn't a big deal acetone is an ingredient in some nail polish removers Acetone is heavier than air so if you use a sufficiently high container fewer fumes will escape If somehow a fire does start it will likely be limited to your container Having a lid handy allows you to starve the fire of oxygen harmlessly putting it out All in all smoothing using acetone is not very dangerous Acetone isn't suspected to be carcinogenic though it isn't something you should be careless around either The risk of starting a fire is small On the other hand solvents like MEK used for smoothing PLA aren't as nice by far and should only be handled with a respirator  Repeated exposure to acetone can lead to the skin becoming sensitised which means that it in the future it will become overly irritated at the slightest contact On a more mundane note it is an excellent degreaser and dries your skin something rotten And then your fingertips can split and take days or weeks to close up hurting in the meantime  Safety Advice for Acetone Handling/Usage Please remember that you handle acetone at your own risk By using this advice you agree to hold me harmless and not sue me as a result of using these instructions/advice Remember that I am not a professional chemist or a lawyer this isn't professional or legal advice I encourage you to research safety precautions and risks on your own to build a personal body of knowledge The most effective safety precaution available to you is knowledge the brain is the most important piece of safety equipment This listing of advice for acetone handling is generated from the highlights of a Material Safety Data Sheet MSDS for acetone After reading this advice you should read an MSDS for acetone directly It would actually be an excellent idea to find and read the MSDS for all the chemicals you use during 3D printing Safety Equipment Wear safety clothing Acetone requires that you wear protective gloves protective eyewear and a respirator to protect your airway It is also highly recommended to wear protective ideally also chemically resistant clothing like a smock or an apron These safety clothes are recommended because acetone is a toxic substance which can absorb through the skin and walls of the lungs directly Make sure to verify the gloves are made of a substance which blocks acetone absorption also verify that your respirator is rated to protect against acetone many respirators are not capable of blocking acetone due to it's volatility Possess prepare and understand how to use an eyewash station a fire blanket a fire extinguisher rated for chemical fires a chemical shower/dousing system and other standard laboratory safety equipment Posting warning signs along the entrances and exits to the work area about working with a volatile flammable and explosive gas is also recommended Keep an inert absorption media readily available to cleanup spills should you accidentally fail to avoid a spill Diatomaceous earth silica/sand and activated charcoal are all potential absorption media Should you have a large spill or not possess absorption media which should not happen always verify safety equipment is present and working before handling chemicals then you may also dilute the spill with water and mop up the dilute solution of acetone No matter which method you use to cleanup a spill remember to dispose of the contaminated cleanup materials according to the requirements/laws of your local area Do not lazily dispose of the acetone down the drain without doing research on the correct disposal methods Control Your Environment Ensure proper ventilation of your workspace ventilation is required in addition to your respirator due to explosion/fire risk If the atmospheric concentration of acetone becomes too high the risk for fires and explosions quickly becomes unacceptable the risk is never going to be zero working with acetone unfortunately but minimizing it is very important Working outside is the perfect way to insure the ventilation is adequate although that presents it's own problems and considerations Alternatives include using a fume hood or even something as simple as a fan blowing air through an open window Eliminate any and all sources of flame or spark for a considerable area around all sources of acetone 10-15 meters minimum Take special precautions to prevent being unknowingly contaminated with acetone which could then be accidentally transported from the work area to a flame source using you as a carrier Personal contamination can lead to injury if you attempt to smoke during a break or at anytime before verifying you are not contaminated It is important to provide an ignition-free environment that extends quite far away from the immediate vicinity of the acetone because acetone can ignite a vapor trail of acetone and allow the flame to travel distances via flashing over the vapor trail Physical isolation is the ideal solution to this dangerous problem A policy of always closing the door to the acetone work area is an example of physical separation which would hopefully prevent this vapor trail flash-over Avoid acetone spills Acetone is an excellent solvent which could easily eat away the paint on your wall or destroy the finish of your table Spills also necessitate following special precautions for cleanup and disposal which have already been provided earlier within this list Acetone Chemistry Do not under any condition mix your acetone with chemicals without an extensive analysis and understanding of the products and the risks associated with the reaction The following list of chemicals will create an explosive compound/mixture when reacted with acetone so do not allow them to come into contact with acetone hydrogen peroxide acetic acid nitric acid nitric acid sulfuric acid chromic anydride chromyl chloride nitrosyl chloride hexachloromelamine nitrosyl perchlorate nitryl perchlorate permonosulfuric acid thiodiglycol hydrogen peroxide potassium ter-butoxide sulfur dichloride 1-methyl-1,3-butadiene bromoform carbon air chloroform thitriazylperchlorate Should you accidentally ignite some acetone you must take additional precautions while evacuating or while attempting to extinguish the fire Acetone is a hydrocarbon and the reaction of burning it produces products which include carbon monoxide CO and carbon dioxide CO2 Essentially humans are incapable of detecting these gases with their senses detectors exist to measure concentration However these symptoms of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide can help alert you to the fact they are present shortness of breath blackness along the edges of your vision confusion headache unconsciousness coma and finally death Carbon monoxide is far more dangerous than carbon dioxide because often the first symptom is unconsciousness which prevents you from evacuating leading to death The dangerous of gas inhalation are substantial enough that as soon as a fire becomes medium-sized you should seriously consider evacuating the area rather than staying to extinguish the fire It is better to lose property to the fire than to die if you die I would guess that your property is destroyed anyway Risk Analysis Acetone is a confirmed developmental toxin for females and a suspected developmental toxin for males as well The risk of breast milk contamination is unknown but it is a suspected toxic contaminant Mutagenic and tetragenic effects are not known The result of this toxicity is that pregnant or breastfeeding women should not handle or be around acetone due to vapors even for short periods of time The risk of cancer and the carcinogenic properties for acetone are not well-defined with some declining to classify acetone as a carcinogen and others classifying it as being carcinogenic California for instance has required that acetone bear a proposition 65 warning about cancer risk Acetone is definitely a toxic substance but it is not highly toxic and accidental ingestion or absorption is essentially incapable of causing severe symptoms Small exposures to acetone like the exposure levels likely encountered during 3D printing are more-or-less not very harmful However if you do get a problematic exposure to acetone contact a poison control center The LD50 lethal dose 50 dose where half of subjects die in rats is 5800 mg/kg making the predictable humans are often similar to rats in regards to toxicity LD50 for an adult human similarly high With such a high lethal dose the predicted toxicity of acetone likely causes chronic sub-lethal damage instead of causing an acute and lethal response If we assume an average adult human 62 kg shares the LD50 of a rat that human would need to consume 392 cc of acetone to reach the LD50 392 cc is nearly equivalent to 4/10 L meaning that there is essentially no chance the small consumption of acetone caused by working with it could poison an adult human if our assumptions are correct Potential effects of inhalation ingestion or skin absorption of acetone dry skin nausea vomiting skin irritation eye irritation burning sensation redness tearing inflammation corneal injury depression fatigue excitement stupor insomnia hypersomnia ataxia tremors dizziness drowsiness confusion headache muscle weakness loss of motor coordination speech abnormalities narcotic effects coma kidney damage liver damage brain damage and death ",

        "answers": " Prints benefit from higher microstepping in two ways Noise level Using microstepping reduces noise from your printer's operation Print quality Using higher resolution microstepping does not increase the physical accuracy of your prints meaningfully but it can reduce surface artifacts such as moire  You will likely not see a noticeable improvement by upgrading from a 16x or 32x to a 64x or 128x microstepping driver Depending on the motors you're driving and the size of the load you could actually see a decrease in quality Although microstepping increases theoretical resolution it does not necessarily increase accuracy The reason is that microstepping significantly limits the incremental torque of the motor This means that you may ask for a step but not get one because the torque of the step won't be enough to actually turn the shaft As an example a motor running in full steps will have 100 of its rated holding torque Moving to 16 microsteps/full steps drops this to 10 128 drops it to 1 The practical effect of this is that in high torque situations such as printing at fast speeds the motor may end up skipping some of the steps In this way the increase in resolution can actually lead to a decrease in accuracy smaller steps but they may not actually be taken A relevant calculation to do would be to work out what the different number of microsteps to full steps works out to in terms of horizontal vertical or whatever movement the motor drives You can do this by measuring how far the stepper moves said surface in one revolution provided you know the number of steps it takes per revolution Example With no microstepping 1 turn/inch 200 steps/turn 200 steps/inch or 005 inch/step 127 micron resolution With 16x microstepping 16 200 steps/inch or 0003 inch step 8 micron resolution In this example 128x microstepping would be absolutely foolish Every situation is different and you should use this information to make a decision based on your setup Many manufacturers have recommendations on how far their motors can be microstepped ",

        "comments": "Checking wires for damage could prevent something worse but is there really any advantage to checking other parts periodically I think that such a check is only needed when you notice a deterioration in print quality.Never hurts to preemptively catch issues Some of those are easy to check Others require reviving the bed I wouldn't bother with those since it would require a calibration again.Especially with high speed/vibration printers it's important to inspect screws and nuts periodically just to ensure they don't shake themselves loose.Generally speaking you should never open a stepper motor that you intend to use again in some of them the magnets used will be weakened if the motor is disassembled without the use of an iron keeper Further there's a risk of getting contaminants into the small gap between the rotor and stator In theory there are ways to carefully do a bearing replacement but it's unlikely to be worth the trouble on a stepper of the sort used in desktop 3d printers.",

        "answers": " Food safety is a property of both the process and the material You can't stick food-safe material in a printer that has previously been used to print something food-dangerous and expect the result to be food safe The only way to know if a given material is food-safe is to ask your supplier but a lot depends on how you then process it For instance FDM printers often have brass nozzles which contain lead To print food-safe materials you need to use a stainless steel nozzle Food safe materials can be identified by mean of an universal symbol Moreover to ensure food-safety of a 3D printed model you may need to further process it for instance by vapor smoothing or coating with a food-safe lacquer Some claims circulate on the internet that 3D printed models may have surface porosity in which bacteria can grow but I've not been able to find a reliable source for this claim Still you need to be cautious  There are 3 things that might affect food safety of 3D printed objects The filament it's food safe only if it says so on the package even if the plastic is not toxic you don't know about the color and other additives The hotend the hotend and nozzle may leak metals into the filament you need something like a full stainless steel hothead And finally 3D printed objects contain little holes that bacteria can get into so nothing printed on an FDM printer is food safe unless coated with some food safe sealing material except for single use  Food Contact Substances There are regulatory agencies in most developed countries that regulate food containers In the USA the Food and Drug Administration FDA regulates Food Contact Substances FCS which are materials that come into contact with food during production manufacturing storage packing and use They have many lists of FCS which are either approved for use generally recognized as safe regulated restricted or otherwise already evaluated and for which they have recommendations It is up to the manufacturer to ensure that FCS are safe so the liability rests with the person making the 3D prints If you make something that looks like a cup and could be confused with a cup you may be responsible for following these guidelines US FDA regulation for ABS and PLA The FDA has an online resource to help guide manufacturers through these lists Determining the Regulatory Status of Components of a

an item it lists the three monomers that constitute ABS seperately so you have to read through the Acrylonitrile section the butadiene section and the styrene sections seperately to understand the food safety aspects of ABS Of course someone has gone to the trouble of parsing all these different regulations in different countries and created a book that summarizes much of what you can glean from individual databases Global Legislation for Food Contact Materials J S Baughan but it's not an inexpensive resource and needs constant update so may need to be repurchased each year to keep up

        "answers": " Here are few things to consider from my point of view Printing technology The first thing that you need to take into account is printing technology The most common[citation needed right now is Fused Filament Fabrication Liquid light-sensitive resin is being used in Stereolitography and Digital Light Processing the SLA printers I found are less common and more expensive than FFF ones Price Need to decide on budget You can buy printer for 60k USD and 400 USD Quality is somehow linked to price but that's not a rule You can buy a shitty printer for a lot of money Printing area Bigger allows you to print bigger things You need to ask yourself how big things you really want to print Remember that 3d printing is quite slow process how often you will want to print big things that will take 60hrs to finish Printing materials What kind of materials you want to print with Some materials will need higher temperatures so check the max hot-end temperature some will require heated bed Assembled or DIY kit You can usually get kits for self-assembly cheaper than Ready-To-Print machines However it will require additional skills i.e soldering tools and time to assemble I am not sure if I would buy DIY kit for commercial use but as an enthusiast I immensely enjoyed putting my Rostock Max together Reviews and reputation It is generally safe to buy printer that already has some users Beware of new magical Kickstarter printers which will change the 3d printing forever Reddit r/3dprinting suggests that your new printer should meet 3 criteria Printer passes the youtube test has lots of youtube evidence that this particular printer is working Printer is out of the pre-order phase This means that all pre-orders have been delivered Printer has a reputation of working well among current users I found it to be a very good set of rules Upgrade capabilities That's very user-dependent but this point is very important to me I want to be able to change and improve certain parts of my printer Check if you can switch the extruder replace the hot-end etc Support I think one of the most important points See if you can find a forum for your printer and how active community is It will be immensely helpful if something goes wrong and it will Also company support is very important What will happen if you need a replacement part or your printer will stop working altogether This list is definitely not complete There are many more things that might be taken into account like configuration delta or XY multiple extruders closed cases etc  One of the biggest questions you should ask yourself is What is your end goal Is it to get your printer and immediately print something pre-assembled Is it to learn about 3d printing by constructing a kit encountering all kinds of potential issues getting it working then once it is working getting everything all dialed in and then getting good prints The 2nd option requires less initial investment but may take considerable time and frustration I did this 6 months ago  I think the list of masteusz is a good one but before you can decide on what you need you have to get a better understanding of how 3D printing works like Silver Quettier said Please be aware that printing a object is yet not as easy as printing on paper The machines that print 3D are more like industrial machines than that they are like your inkjet printer at home For the curious beginner I would suggest to first concentrate on modelling and printing technique Modeling You can of course download things from ThingyVerse or YouMagine but you might be more interested in making things than printing them I don't know Windows 10 3D design I personally find Sketchup Modeling software a good entry-point because they have a large set of video tutorials and while you learn you can add more complicated extensions to the program There are also extensions that help you make your model watertight and ready for print Of course you can find heaps of tutorials on Youtube for other modeling software like freeCAD or Fusion but you might find it a bit overwhelming Printing As suggested in the comments you could start with letting your objects print by others It's worth to set aside a small budget for that They easiest to design for is SLS printing You don't have to worry about overhangs etc Buying a SLS printer is not an option but you can have it print at multiple printingfarms like Shapeways You soon enough find out that making a print light and hollow will save a lot of cash Shapeways will tell you if there is anything wrong with your design too A bit harder is FDM printing where layers of threads are stacked Because overhangs need support most of the time extra plastic is printed that has to be removed later Plastic is not expensive and insides can be printed hollow so cost is not so much a thing you have to worry about when designing On 3Dhubs you can find experienced people who own a printer and want to print for you They can tell you what is printable and what not If you have a hub near you this is a good option to get familiar with the technique If you did that a couple of times you can decide to go to a fablab or makerspace where you lent/rent a printer Make yourself familiar with slicing software like Cura before you go There are many settings like for filling the space in the object and for making support for parts that hang in the air When you buy a printer you probably print mostly with PLA and ABS and all printers can print that Even when you own a printer you might sometimes want to print a part at Shapeways because of the material options or to make something that is impossible to print 3DHubs gives you the possibility to experiment with a large range of printer and materials Print quality though is often influenced by the experience level of the person printing it so don't deside what printer to buy on these results 3DHubs has a good printer-guide On the other hand having a printer yourself makes it a lot easier and more fun to print objects you have downloaded Also making something seeing the result and then adjusting it is a more organic way to learn and create designs Welcome to 3D printing  The number one most important thing about a 3-d printer is the Extruder/PrintHead component If these are buggy the printer is worthless Seems like most printers are pretty good with everything else The place that they die is in the Extruder/Print Head assembly The second most important thing is quality of the plastic parts One nice thing about that is you can usually reprint the plastic parts by going to thingiverse.com and downloading them So I'm on my 2nd printer I returned the first one to amazon and may very well return the second one It is a frustrating game On thing I notice is that VERY FEW printers have a LOT of ratings Some might have 4 stars but only 8 votes The latest one I have had 200 votes but a 3.5 rating If you have 200 votes and anything below 4.2 you've got an inconsistent and potentially crappy product So to sum up Get details on the extruder Does it cool properly is the design such that the filament is properly driven and pushed Is the hot head the only hot part or is the tube getting heated too Does the extruder throat near the hot head have a Teflon tube inside it Read the ratings on Amazon read the bad reviews and then look at the pictures of the product to verify them Best of luck I'm about to return 2 printer and perhaps part out 3 Not quite sure yet ",
        "comments": "I am not sure that this is a good question Perhaps you should ask about the significance of a specific feature rather than requesting a list of all possible options?I was in your shoes a few years back and I strongly recommend against buying a 3D printer as a completely new enthusiast If possible I would suggest joining a FabLab near you to give it a try on a rented machine before buying.When I started researching what machine to buy I tried to absorb as much information as possible Luckily here in London we have iMakr and they run free weekly courses and information sessions If you are not near enough to London or NY try hooking up on 3DHubs.com they have a really helpful forum.Thanks SilverQuettier for mentioning FabLabs I hadn't heard of them before well as a new enthusiast I haven't heard of much yet but there are some near to me Leeds UK)First Questions you need to answer are 1 Fused plastic filament extrusion or Cured Resin Fused plastic is easier and cheaper to start with Resin is slower and more expensive 2 What size things do you want to make Most medium size printers will print something the size of a shoe For small things and parts that fit together this will be ok If you want to print full masks or lampshades in single pieces you will need larger larger more expensive 3 Budget This will help with the question of kit version over complete machine Checkout imakr.com for prices in UK and US.",

        "answers": " It sound like you just have a defective thermocouple But I just did a google search for Why are thermocouples inaccurate and found this article on identifying bad thermocouples and preventative maintenance I never thought of a lot of the tips in the article but I haven't had such drastic temperature errors either  Thermocouples work by passively generating VERY small voltages via the Seebeck effect usually a few tens of millivolts They're literally just a pair of wires made from two different special alloys electrically connected together at the hot end That wire junction can be mounted inside whatever kind of attachment tip or lug is desired The fact that they're very simple and passive devices makes them extremely precise and consistent between TCs of the same type MUCH more so than thermistors Any type-K thermocouple in the world will give you the same accurate output 1-2C or so You can even cut a thermocouple in half re-twist the ends of the wires together and it'll still work However the very small millivolts signal they generate is quite susceptible to electrical noise and circuit design The signal voltage has to be greatly amplified to be useful So it doesn't take much EMR from your heater or stepper wires to interfere with the TC reading A frequent problem with TC circuits in 3d printers is the dreaded GROUND LOOP if the hot tip is electrically connected to the hot block voltage and current on the heater and motor wires can induce small currents through the TC wires that totally screw up the millivolt signal The amplifier picks up these stray voltages and it throws off the temp read So there are some important guidelines for keeping noise out of the TC wires The TC wires must be electrically insulated from the mounting hardware eye lug thermowell whatever your extruder has You can check this with a multimeter you want infinite out of range resistance from the TC leads to the mounting tip and hot block While you're at it make sure your heater cartridge wires aren't shorting to the hot block that's unsafe and can also cause problems with TCs Keep the two TC wires close together and not immediately parallel to noise sources like PWM-controlled heaters or stepper wiring If you must run the TC in a bundle with the other wires TWIST the heater/stepper wiring pairs For steppers twist each coil pair to a different pitch if possible You don't need to twist the separate coil pairs to each other Another common issue with TC circuits is the COLD JUNCTION COMPENSATION A thermocouple doesn't measure tip temperature it measures the DIFFERENCE in temperature between the hot tip and the cold junction where the TC is connected to either the amp or copper wiring The TC amp has an onboard thermistor that it uses to add the temp at the cold junction to the measured signal from the thermocouple There are a few things you need to do to make sure the cold-junction compensation works properly You should run TC wire all the way from the hot tip to the TC amp You CAN splice it and install plugs but only with more type-K TC wire and proper type-K thermocouple plugs These use the same metal as the TC wire so they don't generate undesired junction voltages that interfere with the TC signal If you splice copper wire between the TC and the amp any temp differences along the copper will not be measured This is a particularly big problem if you splice to copper inside a warm enclosure and then run copper to an amp outside the enclosure The amp should not be super hot The onboard thermistor is designed to accurately measure temperatures reasonably close to room temp not hot-block temps There should not be large temperature gradients near the amp or between the TC wire termination and the actual amp chip Place the amp far enough away from the hot end and other heat sources like stepper motors that it isn't experiencing weird temp profiles If you do the above the TC will output a good signal and the amp will read it properly But there's one more hitch The mainboard has to know how to understand the amp's output 3D printer control boards that are designed exclusively for TCs like Mightyboards usually use digital communication between the amp and the main control chip MCU This is high-reliability and does not require any special firmware configuration support is baked in But if you're strapping an external TC amp onto a board that is expecting thermistors you will have to tell the firmware how to read the signal from the amp The most common technique is for the amp to output a linear voltage signal to the MCU's normal thermistor input ADC Then you configure the firmware to use the appropriate thermistor table really a voltage lookup table for that particular amp Depending on your controller board you also may need to make sure the regular thermistor pull-up/pull-down resistors aren't affecting the amp's output So you need to make sure You don't have electrical noise issues The cold-junction compensation is working as intended The firmware and controller board is configured correctly for your amp chip's output If you do all that a TC should give superior accuracy and reliability over a thermistor ",
        "comments": "Very nice question!Is there a big difference in cost between thermocouples vs thermistors?Maybe 10 for a type K thermocouple plus 10 extra for the amplifier board you need for it 1 or less for a thermistor judging by a quick web search.@MartinCarney Relevant http electronics.stackexchange.com/q/24975/25159 Just to add to this I went through much of the same after switching to an all-metal E3D and having a thermistor fail I was able to print for a while using the thermocouple and then had no end to my issues Temperature bouncing 20C every update and very inconsistent I tried several different boards thermocouples and even went as far as a separate power supply for the board I ended up removing the diode from one for some reason and that board can be found here https oshpark.com/shared_projects/p8Yv87Ks but I don't believe it helped at all.Thanks for the reference good article It would have to be 2 defective thermocouples since I have dual extruders And I can heat them and read a tiny voltage change with a meter directly connected to them so they're not completely dead.Thanks Lots of good info there I didn't try moving the TC wires well away from the motor/heater/limit wires or twisting the latter that's worth a shot I'll post back when I try it though since I have a working printer with the thermistors I may not mess with it for a while ",

hold that speed before slowing down blue line For instance setting acceleration 3000 length 30 and speed 150 means it will travel 4 mm before reaching its desired speed of 150 mm/s while that same acceleration theoretically could give a speed of 300 mm/s for the given distance Calculating speed acceleration and jerk In many cases your printer will have some limitation in maximum speed or settings given by your provider that can be used as a starting point If not trial and error is the most straightforward way of doing it I would separate speed calibration into three task First find the maximum speed your printer can tolerate One way of doing this is to print an object with long travel distances and vary the maximum travel speed Using the calculator above increase the acceleration for various traveling distances until you get suitably smooth acceleration curves for your desired speed for medium to long traveling distances Adjust your jerk setting to allow for quick speedup on short traveling distances Jerk speed is the speed that the printer will immediately jump to before taking acceleration into account With a jerk of 20mm/s the printer will make an immediate jump from 0 to 20 mm/s and thereafter speed up to the desired speed by following the acceleration profile As a rule of thumb it might be smart to then set the actual speed jerk and acceleration approximately 20 below the the maximum found as a safeguard when printing Also bear in mind that the strength of stepper motors lowers for higher speeds so that the nozzle will not hold its path very well if obstructed If this becomes a problem consider lowering the speed  As Tom pointed out binary search is the best way In case that term isn't familiar to all readers here's a little more detail 1 establish an acceleration value that you're sure is too low call it L and one that you're sure is too high H It sounds like you know such values already from experience 2 figure out the speed in the middle L+H 2 Call that M 3 Try printing at speed M Something like a stepped calibration cube might be a good choice of object plenty available on thingiverse 4 If M is still too fast take M as your new high-speed limit that is reset H to the value of M and repeat from step 2 5 If it's slow enough to work take M as your new low-speed limit L and repeat from step 2 Each repetition will cut the range in half Keep repeating until L and H get as close as you want say within 5 of each other or so I wouldn't bother trying to get super-close because the workable value will vary somewhat over time

of the slicing program you use you name it Hope that helps Steve  Most printers use between 2000 and 5000 mm/s 2 extrusion moves are usually 2000 on average between different printers travel is normally seen at 3000-5000 though for most lower end or duel direct drive extruder heavy printers this value should be lower some as low as 500-1000 some as high as 2000 for travel Heavier extruders need lower values as well a slower jerk values to avoid the motors skipping The jerk setting being set lower can actually be beneficial as this makes for smoother extrusion after a corner or a hole some people will see ripples near these areas as it accelerates out of the direction change lower values make these ripples smaller but slightly increase print time I've just modified mine with a

the X and Y skip as it jerks around the plate especially in high resolution models particularly high resolution circles with 200 faces on the vertical axis because the printer tries to jerk after each node normally that isn't an issue but in heavy designs the jerk setting needs to be lowered I had my jerk at 20 for XY and its now at 4 after having tested and failed 8 and 15 values The acceleration was at 2000 for both extrusion and travel some firmwares don't allow separate values for travel and extrusion moves but if yours does it's best to have travel value about double the print moves when your travel is twice the speed of extrusion moves so use that 1-1 formula in relation to speed scale it for each desired speed set in the slicer Mine has been tested at 2000 1500 1000 and 800 failing all of them with jerk setting of 5 Now testing 500 for acceleration and beginning to get a little confused as to why this is happening Now I'm having second thoughts After going as low as 800 from 2000 and still getting skipping seemingly worse am I getting this backwards here Do I need a higher value if the motor is skipping on quick moves My understanding is that lower is better for those problems but perhaps I've confused myself ",
        "comments": "[Binary search https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm i.e trying values until you find one that works.Excellent last point my printer has a big Y-axis 1200mm so lots of inertia I had to run the stepper very slow for it to have enough torque to turn the leadscrew at all I switched to a 5-start lead screw so it spins 1/5 as fast for the same motion and no more problems.@TextGeek Thanks This is the kind of thing you figure out the hard way My introduction to the stepper motor strength curve was that very minor defects due to leveling the bed too close would push the nozzle off its path during high speed travels.That seems like an interesting calibration method Is there somewhere I can read more about this?It's a very common method for searching in computer programs Look up binary search and you'll find lots of information I don't know of any good references on using it for hardware optimization in particular.I do not completely understand how you get to the number of somewhat less than 5 seconds The calculator should show length on the x-axis and the acceleration could theoretically give a speed of 300 mm/s on a length of 30 mm as given by you while taking into account that the printer has to accelerate and deaccelerate by the given 3000 mm/s^2 Do I see this correctly Otherwise excellent answer!@kamuro excellent question I added an image where I have highlighted the info Notice where the green line intersects the x-axis at approximately 4 seconds But it cannot be coincidence that the x-axis of the graph scales with field distance or axis length can it?@kamuro I think you are absolutely right The x-axis has to be the distance travelled and not the time Then the green line would mean it takes 4 mm to reach the desired speed and not seconds Now that I think about it 4 seconds is a tremendously long time for a stepper motor to speed up I have updated the image/explanation.Hi and welcome to SE 3D Printing Your answer whilst informative seems to include a question It would be better to ask your own question using the link at the top of the page as this is a Q&A site not a threaded forum You could always link back to this answer in order to maintain the context of your query.",

        "answers": " Lubricating the filament is the most common solution I've heard of to stop filament jams and clogs Lubricating makes for a smoother ride through the print head While you're at it make sure that the filament is clean The best way to stop jams from dust is to get rid of the dust in the first place Some people recommend canola oil which I've heard works reasonably well for both ABS and PLA though especially for PLA You can even 3D-print dust filters/lubricators if you think this could be a serious issue I personally try to clean the print head regularly after every couple prints or even after each print if I have time Something sharp like tweezers can pick off bits of filament near the tip of the nozzle I haven't tried other utensils yet but there are certainly other tools that would work I've also heard of people regulating temperature with a fan in order to prevent partially melted bits of filament clogging up the inside of the nozzle but I don't know if that's effective In some cases the problem could even be as mundane as a support issue I once set up a spool of filament only to have a jam when the support for the spool failed leaving the line of filament tugging at the nozzle and clogging it Taking steps to prevent this from happening can be simply and effective Whatever the cause preventative measures are always my choice  Different types of hotends and extruders can lead to different problems associated with clogging Based on my personal experience the leading causes of clogs and jams are the following Foreign material in the nozzle dirt dust low quality filament Mixing materials in the hotend running ABS at 220 then switching to PLA without purging the nozzle Excessive retraction or heat soak in PLA PLA expands when heated if your retraction is set to high you can actually push the expanded PLA high enough that it cools down and can no longer flow To solve these issues I recommend using one type of filament preferably decent quality typically 40 per kg if you swap materials be sure to completely purge your nozzle of the higher temperature material Set your retraction as low as you can trying to minimize ooze try 4 mm for all metal hotend or 2-3 mm for makerbot style To minimize carbonized plastic in your hotend don't leave your hotend's heater on for extended periods of time One way to keep dust from accumulating on your filament is to cover your rolls when you aren't using them I personally use hairnets you can buy a 12 pack for a couple of dollars and they last for a long time  As general advice regardless of your printer extruders tend to clog if Some of them might not apply to every printer but they should be as general as possible you let the filament run out mid print most extruders have a dead zone between the grinding wheel and the hot end in which if the filaments stays stuck there your only option is to open the extruder you let a filament create knots with no one present to readily fix the knots or the grinding wheel will saw the filament leading to 1 plus a clogged grinding wheel more often than not the quality of a filament brand is measured by the presence or absence of knots you let the hot head stay hot without printing for too long it will fill of melted filament leading to risk of it carbonizing inside the extruder leading one again to 1 you use flex or rubber material which have the added complexity of grinding against the common plastic guides of the filaments feeders depending on the material used you might decide to avoid using the guides and feeding the extruder directly you print at higher qualities e.g 0.1 mm leads to lower filament throughput that can become stuck if the nozzle is too wide and the grinding wheel goes too fast you never clean i.e blowing will suffice the grinding wheel filament dust sticks there increasingly over time you let the extruder is too close to the plate if the filament is not free to fall on plate as it should settings-wise it will fill the hot end back up leading to clogs you print wood brick and derivate filaments they are highly unhealthy for the extruder since they are plastic/resin charged with wood powder The powder tends to a burn and b stick to the internal walls of the extruder If I can think of more I will add them  First you don't To reduce the likelyhood use good plastics without contaminations Do not over heat the plastic causes faster carbon build up Buy hand drills mini drills to clear it Don't switch materials around a lot Low temp plastic residue will cook when you switch to high temp plastic Again carbon Last will come to your extruder is self Use a hardened extruder tip less likely to wear All metal should help a lot too PTEF tubes often get baked in a jam situation Or do what I do I use a giant 1mm nozzle I have printed at least 20 lbs of plastic on the same nozzle The other solutions say put oil etc I will just say that is not a great idea First you will have terrible bed adhesion second it just seems wrong Not to mention it will be out of the extruder within one KG The only time its okay to use oil is if you have a bowden setup ",

        "answers": " If your printer is printing support material that is too strongly attached you can increase the space between the support and the part in some slicing softwares On Cura it is located in the expert settings menu you can open it by pressing Ctrl E under the Support text Try fiddling with the Z distance setting until you find the right setting You can also change the type of support and support infill amount and see if it have any positive or negative effect Edit I think you should also redesign your part it seems that it cannot lock the bushing on The semicircle should be a bit smaller to have a bit of space between your two parts This way the bushing will be secured firmly by the tightening force of the screws and precision should be less of an issue  I think a lot of this depends on the slicing engine you're using as to what options you have I use MakerWare now MakerBot Desktop which has many options for the support scaffolding as well as other useful settings for your situation As someone else stated adjusting the distance even slightly can make a world of difference in how easy the supports are removed Also bear in mind that supports can be more difficult to remove with larger layer heights so try printing in a lower layer height Often times you shouldn't need to use support structures for a feature like this I might suggest printing without supports at a reduced speed and lowered nozzle temperature This will help ensure that the material hardens quicker which becomes helpful higher along the arc Related to the suggestion above you can focus your slicing setting on better bridging This should give better control on feeds/speeds while bridging a gap between overhanging features Some slicing engines allow you to specify a different layer height for these areas on the print So I would try printing with reduced print speed nozzle temperature(s and layer height with supports My machine has a range of 0.1mm to 0.3 but I've had more success printing between 0.12mm and 0.15mm layer height with scaffolding in mind Last suggestion when absolutely all else fails purchase some sort of dissolvable filament ie PVA water soluble and set your scaffolding-to-part distance really close and print Obviously this only works if you have a multi-extruder head or a lot of time on your hands to swap the materials and adjust the nozzle temperature for each layer please don't do that  I believe the post by tbm0115 covers many of the general options However I would also consider installing additional fans to improve cooling of the model during printing As pointed out by this excellent article installing a fan can significantly reduce issues the from printing overhangs Regarding the type of fan to get they stated that It seems that the fan shroud you choose is less important than the fan type The blower fan was consistently weighted above the stock 40 mm fan regardless of shroud Using a blower also gives you the best possible airflow through any shroud you decide to use In addition in my experience adding having two or more fans blowing on the model from different directions will further improve overhang performance This is because all parts of the print are less likely to experience lack of cooling due to wind shadow or drag  Here are all the ways I can think of Turn the temperature down just a little which may reduce sagging Crank up cooling like bigger fan(s aimed at the print so it solidifies faster Change orientation when possible not in this case Use soluble support material and wash it away afterwards requires 2-head printer Pause the print as you go up and insert support material manually ick Omit support material at the very top Machine out the support material afterwards with a more precise tool like a drill or sander the same diameter as the bearing I'm eagerly waiting for a BoxZY printer that can swap in a milling head in place of the extruder Remove support material as now but if you remove too much fill the gap after installing the bearing to prevent wobbling epoxy hot-melt glue melted PLA etc might work depending on how the part will end up being used Add a set-screw to secure the bearing Of course these all have tradeoffs but I hope at least one of them might help Steve  You could modify it as shown in my picture I added lines tangent to the 11mm circle and in this example I set them to a 40 degree overhang which should be fine the top line is also tangent to the circle and in my experience it's easier to bridge a small section rather than do a bunch of small overhangs like an arc would do You still end up with quite a bit of contact but also easy to print I did something similar to this on my printer where the smooth rods enter horizontal holes  I had to design something rather like this but I made the part that wraps around the pipe pipe in my case bushing in yours into a separate piece that slotted into the main arch That way the main arch could be printed with poor precision on the overhang and the sleeve was printed on its side It took a little work to make the slotting system fit well but it was fine The two arches screwed together to grip two sleeve sections It also meant I could print the big parts quickly because their precision was less critical If as you suggest you absolutely have to print it this way then how about pulling the top of the arch up a little make it a bit gothic if you see what I mean This is a variation on tjb1's idea above but rather than have a flat at the top organize it so there's a gentle point That way the printer isn't trying to draw a critical fitting over empty space and the area that prints poorly is away from the bushing You might have the slack to put supports back in ",

        "answers": " There's no appreciable difference Just use the filament that fits your particular printer If you don't yet have a printer then I'd get one that uses 1.75mm filament 1.75mm is increasingly becoming the standard thus being easier to get Some filaments are not available as 3mm 1.75mm filament allows for finer control because feeding in 1mm of filament corresponds to less plastic extruded 1.75mm filament requires less force to extrude Compressing 1.75mm down to 0.3mm takes less force than doing the same to 3mm filament However the advantages are fairly minor I don't see any reason to replace a functioning 3mm extruder with a 1.75mm one yet  There are a few factors to consider those two 3mm More rigid easier to print with flexible plastics I couldn't make my 1.75mm printer print with NinjaFlex using standard bowden extruder Can extrude faster Quality is less affected by changes in diameter it is a concern mostly when using cheap plastics 1.75mm More popular easier to buy Needs smaller extruder than 3mm Easier to use with bowden tube More precise when printing  I think as do a lot of others that the differences are rather minor So just my 2 things I know from experience We've been using 3 mm for some years and now we are moving towards 1.75 1.75 mm filament is very easy to entangle especially if it is not on spool You can even easily create knots on the filament and it is very hard to untangle As long as you keep it on spool and always buy on spool you should be fine 3 mm filament on the other hand creates very high tension when the spool is about to end Sometimes the last couple of meters are unusable because of this and you have to throw the rest of the spool away  I generally agree with the points in masteusz's and Tom van der Zanden's answers but I would add a bit more detail Generally the differences are minimal however Generally speaking a 1.75mm filament will make it easier to use a smaller nozzle diameter lt;0.4mm allowing for more precise prints in some cases 1.75mm filament will give you better flexibility with flow rates as it has a higher surface to volume ratio allowing for faster melting in the nozzle and allowing you to push your printer to higher volume extrusion rates The converse of the above points is also usually true 3mm filament which is usually actually 2.85mm will allow for better control and higher extrusion rates on wider nozzle diameters 1.75mm filament is indeed more popular than 2.85mm however the smaller diameter means that manufacturing tolerances really need to be tighter along the length of the filament\u2014a 0.1mm difference in width along the length of your filament is only 3.5 for 2.85mm and more like 6.7 for 1.75mm so you're going to have a bigger difference in actual flow rates compared to your expected flow rate set in your slicer resulting in lower-than-expected print quality That means you're probably going to want to spring for more expensive higher quality 1.75mm filament in order to get good prints Your printer's hardware setup matters too Bowden-based printers like the Ultimaker 2 generally have more luck with the thicker filament because thinner stuff will usually compress more in the bowden tube and create a stronger spring effect causing extra pressure in the nozzle This will often cause blobbing stringing and over-extrusion and hamper the positive effect of your retractions Ultimately you can tune your printer and slicer settings to create or negate most any of the differences in print quality caused by filament diameter but you may have an easier time with certain prints and printers with one diameter over the other  I agree with all the answers above but only would like to add if you want to build a very large printer using 0.8mm or 1.2 mm nozzle i would advice to go 3mm 1.75mm filament then just can't be fed in fast enough  One thing I haven't seen anyone mention yet is the issue of the size vis-a-vis time of the final print 3mm filament allows the printer to spit out a lot of plastic at once letting you build must taller prints much faster Larger filament can also provide a much wider base for the next layer to rest on smaller filament needs to print multiple times side-by-side to get the same width Of course the fineness of the layers will suffer but you can go about twice as high in one pass compared to when you use the smaller filament On the flip side the smaller filament will more easily print extremely fine layers than the bigger filament So it's a trade off Consider the printers building items feet or tens of feet in height They use filaments that are measured in centimeters or decimeter a instead of millimeters ",
        "comments": "You mention some very good points Do you think this mean printers with 1.75 mm extruders struggle less with for instance stringing?Actually this is a pretty common misconception I've done a fair few tests and the filament diameter is basically irrellevant The main factors in determining how much material your printer can spit out in a period of time volume extrusion rate commonly measured in mm^3/sec are the nozzle diameter of the extruder and rate that your heating element can transmit heat to melt the filament In fact if you can hold everything else constant 3mm filament typically cannot print as quickly as 1.75mm filament because it takes longer to heat the filament through to the core.Now to add to my above comment in practice your filament feed rate is usually limited due to firmware mechanics of nozzle pressure or something else in such a way that you'll rarely hit the point where you can't heat the material fast enough so nozzle diameter is usually your limiting factor since it tends to be quite small.Actually the opposite is true since the 1,75mm is easier to heat up since it is thinner But that is only a problem at the high speeds you need for 1.2mm nozzles.",

        "answers": " It may work for a short time but you're going to fill the melt chamber quickly and possibly overflow to a point where the filament isn't constrained causing a messy jam All the molten plastic will likely flow backwards to a point where the diameter isn't 3mm any longer probably next to your drive gear but depending on the length it may just flow up cool down and jam the extruder No the filament would just pass through unheated and not do anything  Typically an extruder and hot end are designed for one or the other and cannot support the other without mechanical changes The extruder may not be able to grip a smaller diameter filament with enough force to assure even feeding and retraction The hot end however is much more complex The filament has to be pushed with force into the melting zone which means the filament has to slide along an area inside the hot end where the filament is plastic but still put pressure on the filament ahead of it When you put filament into a hot end the filament softens before the melt zone but since the walls of the hot end are just barely larger than the filament it has no choice but to continue pressing down on the liquid filament below With a narrower diameter filament though the filament can heat soften then travel backwards along the sides of the hot end and cool in place jamming the hot end or at least preventing an even continuous flow of plastic Some hot ends will accept a small Teflon tube that takes this space up and allows you to do this with fewer issues and if you like to tinker you can experiment with this but be prepared to learn a lot and fail a lot as you find out the hard lessons of hot end design Generally you should upgrade your entire extruder and hot end setup to the size you want to use ",
        "comments": "Perhaps you should restrict the question to a specific printer and the part about the 1.75mm nozzle should probably be a question in its own right though it is right on the edge of what I'd consider a good-quality question considering the answer will just be no I was mainly asking this as a hypothetical question based off the previous question I mentioned For the 1.75mm nozzle I added that part to clarify what I assume the answer to the first part will be I assume that 1.75mm could be used but only if it was smaller than the nozzle if you normally were using 3mm with a 2.5mm nozzle 1.75 should not work.I don't understand why it would overflow OP correctly mentioned that the settings would have to be changed but once that's done wouldn't the software turn the extruder motor only 1/3 as far to extrude the same volume of filament?In most cases the gap around the filament would be larger than the hole in the nozzle I don't know the math to figure it out but I am assuming it would take less pressure for the molten plastic to go backwards through the larger gap than through the nozzle itself.Now I have to go try this My intuition differs but the best way to know for sure is for us to try it There are some setups that can accept both with only minor configuration changes The stock hotend for the H-1 is one example You slip you mostly slip in an extra tube and slide the hot end over to the over end of the knurled bolt and you're good to go.You just need a teflon liner to prevent this issue that's what the H-1 used to overcome this problem ",

        "answers": " In theory I imagine you can but there are some practical considerations that might need some thought If you have a desktop printer with multiple extruders you could probably print with both one conductive and one structural filament and thereby build circuits in 3D One concern would be the low melting points of most 3D printed filaments since one would have to limit the heat generated by the mounted components and connections so that the structure of the board would not be melted Mounting components to the board would also differ from a normal PCB since you would have to connect the components with the conductive filament without melting the structure of the board In other words you probably would have to use conductive filament as solder and melt components into place Whether you could use typical tools used for mounting SMD components with conductive filament as solder is beyond my knowledge  In addition to the thermal issues Tormod raised there is a conductivity issue Present conductive filaments are much less conductive than copper The power loss may be enough to affect functionality Also the lost power goes to heat making the thermal problems worse For bulk materials volume resistivity is measured in Ohm-cm which is the resistance of a 1 cm cube of the material measured from one entire face to the opposite entire face see https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity Copper has a volume resistivity of about 1.68 micro Ohm-cm Proto-pasta conductive PLA filament claims 15 ohm-cm http www.proto-pasta.com/pages/conductive-pla Functionalize F-Electic&trade claims 0.75 ohm-cm http functionalize.com/about/functionalize-f-electric-highly-conductive-filament Printing itself significantly raises resistivity Proto-pasta claims 30 ohm-cm along X and Y 115 along Z More intuitively each cm of length of a 2.5mm wide printed trace 0.4mm thick should add several hundred ohms with the Proto-pasta or several tens of ohms with the F-electric That may be enough to matter It's probably worth mentioning that there's a specialized PCB printer the Voltera that uses pricey conductive ink and can also dispense solder paste http www.computerworld.com/article/2885188/3d-circuit-board-printer-a-smash-hit-on-kickstarter.html ",

        "answers": " I think the best way to go about this would be to calibrate your printer and slicer as best you can One of my pet peeves is when people upload STLs that have been adjusted to fit their printer/material There are many suppliers of material that vary in quality as well as many materials and different printers that the tolerances shouldn't be built into the part because in the end it usually just makes it harder for others attempting to print the model If you aren't sharing models then all I can say is you are still better off to calibrate your printer and tune your slicer to your material You'll have more luck with models from other people and have an easier time designing your own If you still have trouble then modifying the model is probably the last option I don't know of any CAD programs that can work with problems 3D printers have so experience is going to be your only help I know in Inventor you can go around and Thicken/Offset individual surfaces of the model to compensate or if you had a percentage for your shrinkage you could get creative with formulas in the sketches  I think it's important to remember that a 3D printer is both an R&amp;D tool and a piece of manufacturing equipment As such we should treat it and it's process similarly to other pieces of manufacturing equipment ie mills saws etc Other albeit traditional manufacturing methods such as a mill will typically require post-processing to parts to remove any burrs and clean the parts Since tools like a mill are a subtractive technology it can already hold tight positional/dimensional tolerances However as 3D printing is additive manufacturing it's difficult to hold the same tolerances directly out of the machine as compared to traditional tools For this reason I would suggest planning time for a more traditional process after the print if tolerances and connections are a concern This could be as simple as using a Dremel or using a mill/lathe I would recommend increasing your shell/floor/roof settings in your slicer to accommodate the subtractive process though  Unfortunately different firmwares and different slicers require different calibration techniques There's a lot of software-specific advice out there like printing a single-wall calibration box and measuring the wall thickness That's a good technique for Slic3r but not for Simplify3D It can be very confusing Here's the general outline of what you should do Rough calibration check for printer steps/mm Do the values in your firmware settings make sense for your linear motion hardware For example you can calculate what the theoretical values SHOULD be based on belt pitch and pulley tooth count Print something moderately big 100-200mm and check if it's 1-2 If it's off by more than that your steps/mm is probably wrong Check for mechanical backlash using a backlash-checking print like this one http www.thingiverse.com/thing:252490 Tighten belts and perform other printer-specific tuning required to eliminate backlash Backlash will throw off other calibration steps so make sure there's no slop Follow the recommended extrusion volume calibration steps for your slicer This starts with measuring your filament diameter with calipers and inputting that into your slicer And then you will usually either print a single-walled box and measure the thickness or print a series of 100 infill calibration boxes and adjust the extrusion multiplier to the largest value that looks good without bulging By measuring filament diameter and then adjusting an extrusion calibration setting in the slicer you will be able to measure future filament and prints will come out right Giving the slicer fake diameter values will force you to recalibrate every time the diameter changes Note that you must redo this calibration for each FILAMENT MATERIAL and EXTRUDER DESIGN Different material/extruder pairs will have different bite depths and effective drive diameter Precision calibration check by printing a variety of object sizes and PLOTTING desired size as X and actual size as Y Then find a linear fit equation y=mx+b Do this separately for your printer's X Y and Z axes The value m is your scale error You can use your slicer object scaling to fix this For example ABS usually requires 100.3-101 scaling to account for shrinkage If you have scale error with a low-shrinkage material like PLA you can adjust your firmware's steps/mm value to compensate The value b is your fixed width error Assuming you don't have backlash this is usually caused by the small amount that molten plastic bulges out to the sides or by extrusion volume calibration error You can improve this by fine-tuning your extrusion volume Many slicers also have horizontal/XY size compensation settings that you can use to shrink/expand the part by b/2 to correct the fixed width error Any residual fixed-width error that you cannot correct with slicer settings should be added as a tolerance in your part models If you follow these steps you should get 0.1mm or better dimensional precision on your prints Deltas not included That's a whole other ball of wax  A few suggestions I haven't seen explicitly stated in the other answers Export resolution When you export your STL files you can increase the resolution If dimensional accuracy is extremely critical you'll want to confirm that the STL conversion process hasn't altered the dimensions of curved surfaces outside your max min tolerances I.e open your STL file in you CAD program and then re-measure the resulting surfaces STL conversion for holes makes the wholes slightly smaller and external curved surfaces slightly larger Material Swell I've noticed on my printer that parts are typically slightly larger when printed I've managed to account for this in my CAD model by shrinking certain dimensions slightly in CAD prior to exporting them My dimensions are typically off by about 0.1-0.2mm in XY which if you're making something with close fits it's worth tweaking the file prior to printing Warping If I've got a part that needs to be perfectly flat I'll use a raft with an additional ring or two of helper discs surrounding the part For the flattest side I'll also print this on the build plate If you've got two or more best judgement Angled Flats If i have a part with flat surfaces that are at angles to the the build platform I'll slow my extruder way down 10mm/s is my go to speed Keeping the extruder moving slowly will help to ensure that your edges and walls will be relatively smooth and with the least amount of distortion Calibration and setup Everyone has said it I'll say it again Check your printer prior to a critical print Any sag in your belts will cause drooping Print a test part to ensure that your temperature settings are good for your filament and that your extraction distance will minimize stringing I do a few test prints with a new filament and again about half way through a roll to ensure everything is still working properly and if needed I'll tweak things as needed ",
        "comments": "So basically set printer and filament settings in the slicer to achieve as accurate dimensions as possible regardless of the model printed Then assuming the printer is doing the right thing adjust margins in the CAD to make the parts fit hopefully on any printer Sounds reasonable!That is some very reasonable advice I usually forget to add that extra shell/floor/wall when designing and end up fiddling with some dremel tool on a model not fit to the task.Glad to help I've often screwed myself over during post-processing like reaming a hole to size and end up cutting too deep into the part and reveal the infill I'll typically decrease my hole size in my CAD model by about 0.010 and increase my shell to about 5 or 6 to ensure I can ream the hole without this issue.+1 the tolerances shouldn't be built into the part Great post I do actually have a delta the Kossel Mini but I am sure most of your suggestions can be related to some degree Either way I think this answer deserves to stay for the reference ",

        "body": " My Replicator you know the one made of balsa wood has blown a voltage regulator on its MightyBoard for the second time The first time MakerBot graciously replaced it However they replaced with the same model board with no apparent fix for the commonly faulty voltage regulator I can't afford the now 500 replacement board so my option is to replace the faulty component and hope no further damage was taken on the board As MakerBot Industries did not need me to send in my old board I've followed these steps to try and replace the voltage regulator on the old board I've offset the voltage regulator towards the power jack jumped the remaining pin on the voltage regulator to the remaining lead on the board where the old voltage regulator was but I'm confused what/where the green wire does/goes mine is blue on my machine The image looks like he just soldered it onto the heat sink pad I tried to test it by plugging in the power and the RGB LED strip The stepper motor driver LEDs turned on but the LED strip and none of the other on-board LEDs turned on I'm not very seasoned when it comes to electronics so can anyone explain what the actual pinout should be or suggest other ways to resolve this issue Update Old Board Replacement So far I've replaced the regulator on my old board with some success Before the replacement the board wouldn't turn on on-board LEDs wouldn't turn on Now all of the proper status LEDs turn on but the board seems to be stuck in a boot sequence The LCD screen provides two lines of block characters as it normally does when initializing but just hangs up there I tried connecting the machine to my PC to try and restore the board to factory settings and install the latest firmware However the PC couldn't find the machine and I began to smell a bit of burning I'm not sure if this is a result of permanent damage from the original regulator failing or improper installation of the new regulator I'm going to dig around a bit more before attempting this fix on my main board I'll edit this post as I continue the project Update New Board Replacement So I've now attempted the fix on the newest board the reason for this question The results of this board are the same as the old one I actually get power on the main board but the LCD screen just shows two solid lines I've taken pictures of what I've done ",

        "answers": " The Monoprice Architect is is a bare-bones FlashForge Creator that has been re-badged for Monoprice The Creator line is a very popular set of printers so there is lots of good advice out there The FlashForge Google Group is a good community to join https groups.google.com/forum forum/flashforge The entire FF Creator line in turn is cloned from the original Makerbot Replicator 1 So you can use Makerbot slicing profiles for the Replicator 1 Just keep in mind that Makerbot does not generally test new software revs with their older printers and DEFINITELY does not test new software revs with competitor knock-offs Sometimes they appear to break functionality for non-Makerbot machines on purpose So recent versions of Makerbot Desktop may not play nice with your FlashForge The most recent known good free slicer you should use with this printer is Makerware 2.4.x You can find links by searching the FF Google Group On that note you may have received instructions to use ReplicatorG with your printer But RepG is abandonware development stopped years ago It should only be used for firmware updates not as a slicer You should also only use the most recent version posted on the Sailfish page on Thingiverse http www.thingiverse.com/thing:32084 Using older versions of RepG with newer firmware revs will corrupt your EEPROM Only use the version downloaded from the link above The firmware that comes with the printer is FlashForge's slightly-customized build of either Sailfish or Makerbot's Replicator 1/2/2x firmware But here's the trick Makerbot's Rep1/2/2x firmware is just an old out-of-date slightly customized version of Sailfish Makerbot stopped keeping up with bug-fixes and feature additions a long time ago Everything is Sailfish just different versions You should use the most recent official release version listed at http www.sailfishfirmware.com Follow the instructions in the Sailfish manual from the link above and RepG will automatically pull the right builds from the official mirror and populate a list of printer options to choose The trick here is which build to download As of 1-21-16 there is not an official Monoprice Architect build yet Which would mean editing a machine xml profile to avoid the firmware throwing warnings I STRONGLY recommend getting used to the printer using factory firmware before trying to fight with custom machine profiles But here is the basic process to pick a Sailfish firmware build when you're ready First which Atmega processor version do you have The large chip in the middle of the control board will either say 1280 or 2560 You need to know which version you have Bad things happen if you load the wrong version Second What is the tooth count on the X and Y drivetrain pulleys To my knowledge FF always uses 17-tooth pulleys which matches the Replicator 1 and FF Creator profiles The Rep2 and 2x use 18t pulleys so only use those builds if you have those pulleys People often mess this up and their prints end up with dimensions 5 off in X and Y Third The Architect has one extruder and no heatbed so firmware builds that expect those to be connected Rep 1 Dual Creator etc will throw errors if loaded You can fix this from the LCD screen or RepG but that's a whole separate question Do some printing and learn about the printer before attempting any firmware update so you'll know what to do if you pick a build with the wrong parts Fourth This one is just for the sake of completeness Some FF models were shipped with off-spec heatbeds that require special firmware builds to prevent drawing too much current and overheating overloading the power supply The Architect doesn't have that but firmware builds for those printer models eg I believe the FF Creator 2560 will under-power regular heatbeds This is just something you need to know with the Architect if you decide to install a heatbed later But it's a really critical safety warning for people with those off-spec heatbeds If this all seems complicated that's because FlashForge and in turn Monoprice relies heavily on the open source Sailfish project to maintain the software ecosystem behind this line of printers FlashForge has some internal builds that they use for flashing new bots but these are not kept particularly up-to-date Nor does FlashForge release the source files so it's quite opaque where exactly the stock firmware differs from mainstream Sailfish In the long run you should install mainline Sailfish But it's ok to stick with the factory firmware until you get used to the printer To summarize Because there is not an existing Sailfish build you're going to need to do some investigating and some experimenting to figure out which build will work Don't try that until you're familiar with the printer Post on the FlashForge Google Group when you're ready for help  Since the printer has no heater I'd advise some sleuthing Look at the motherboard Find the big black square chip and see if it is a ATmega 1280 or 2560 Likely it's a 1280 but you never know This will impact which firmware build you use If you will eventually add a heater PCB then figure out the size wattage of the power supply It may be big enough now for a heated platform or maybe not I guess you can cross that bridge if/when you add a HBP heated build platform However it can make a difference as to which firmware build you load as some builds of Sailfish will intentionally serialize heating so as to not put too high of a load on the power supply PSU Armed with the above info you can then decide if you want a 1280 or 2560 build of Sailfish And if you want a build which will serialize eventual use of an HBP or not Serialized MakerBot Replicator 1 Single amp Dual implied ATmega 1280 MakerBot Replicator 1 with ATmega 2560 Non-serialized FlashForge Creator I II amp X implied ATmega 1280 For a non-serialized 2560 build know that the FlashForge one is for a poorly behaved heater PCB and you likely won't want it That sort of leaves you without a good non-serialized choice In a pinch you can use the ZYYX 3D build for a 2560 Or you can contact the Sailfish team directly speaking with very certain knowledge I can assure you that they'd be happy to do a targetted build for your machine However at present they lack info to do so e.g build volume distances from endstops to center of build platform etc ",

        "answers": " It's really more about calibration than resolution a poorly calibrated printer will have dimension errors that prevent mating with true LEGO bricks or other printed bricks Also resolution is an incredibly loaded term for 3d printers because it can mean a lot of different things But we don't need to get into that right now There are really two big things to worry about layer height and extrusion width Layer heights of 0.1mm or 0.2mm should be fine Coarser layers may run into surface finish issues that make the bricks difficult to put together or take apart There probably isn't much reason to go finer than 0.1mm for this application Almost all FFF printers can do 0.1mm layer heights as long as it is reasonably well-tuned Any typical household FFF printer with a normal nozzle size can print fine enough for the bricks to work It just needs to be tuned well The smallest must have feature in a standard lego brick is the 1.6mm thick wall around the sides The typical minimum printable feature size for an FFF printer is 2x the extrusion width because the slicer will place a path on the inside edge of the shape and the outside edge of the shape Some slicers will allow single-extrusion features but this is not generally recommended because it makes weak parts So how wide is the extrusion width It's adjustable and different slicers auto-recommend different values but as a safe rule of thumb it needs to be between 1x and 2x your nozzle size There are some volume calculation quirks in different slicers that may encourage larger or smaller sizes so sometimes people recommend extrusion width nozzle size layer height particularly with Slic3r This is very system-specific Assuming you have the most common stock nozzle with a 0.4mm orifice and also set the extrusion width to 0.4mm the slicer should put four strands in the walls of the LEGO brick That's good Where it gets tricky is if you have an extrusion width that does not evenly divide into 1.6mm Say you are printing with an extrusion width of 0.6mm There is enough room in the wall of the part to place two full 0.6mm perimeter strands but then a gap 0.4mm wide will be left in the center You can't put another 0.6mm strand into that 0.4mm gap Different slicers handle this different ways Some will leave an empty space between the walls and you get a very weak print Some will mash an excessive amount of plastic into the gap causing poor print quality as excess material builds up more and more on each layer Some will push a smaller-than-commanded strand to try to properly fill the volume So the general advice with small features is to make sure your extrusion width goes into the part's minimum thickness a reasonable number of times Feature size extrusion width lt 2 is BAD Feature size extrusion width 2 is GOOD 2 lt Feature size extrusion width lt 3 is BAD Feature size extrusion width 3 is GOOD Although these will vary somewhat by slicer older slicers like Skeinforge tend to have more issues with this than newer slicers What you should do in practice is check your slicer's print previewer to see whether it is leaving a gap between the strands Then adjust extrusion width and perimeter/shell count to try to get an intelligent output There's some trial and error involved ",
        "comments": "The smallest nice to have feature is a tight fit so bricks snap together properly and IIRC 0.1mm is far too large for that.Whether 0.1mm tolerance is adequate depends on the plastic nylon sure PLA nope ABS like real lego bricks may be ok Most of the 3DP-oriented brick designs I've seen modify some design details to make them more suitable for somewhat looser tolerances.That said if you're tuning specifically to print a single type of thing over and over you can hit 0.05mm or better pretty consistently The motion system resolution in a typical household/hobbyist 3d printer is 10 micron and plastic volume control precision adds a little variance onto that The design clearance between actual lego bricks is 0.1mm for example so 0.05mm should be adequate.Some looking around says that Lego has a mold tolerance of 0.005mm which apparently translates into 0.01mm in the finished parts.Yeah we're simply not going to hit that with hobbyist FFF printers I think people making their own bricks will generally tolerate a little bit less consistency in snap-feel though.I printed a few blocks in PLA with a 0.4 nozzle the printer wasn't perfectly tuned but the blocks still fit barely So with really careful tuning it may work ok.",

        "answers": " It's important to understand what specifically is being compared CLIP is much faster than bottom-up technologies that require a peel step between every layer For example the Form1 galvo SLA printer tilts the resin vat to separate the transparent bottom from the print That is by far the slowest part of SLA/DLP printing with most modern light sources Where the speed comes in is that without a peel a continuous movie can be used to cure the resin rather than a series of alternating images and peels Top-down printers can print dramatically faster than bottom-up-and-peel printers CLIP is not necessarily faster than top-down For example the Gizmo 3D line of top-down printers are very similar in print speed to CLIP http www.gizmo3dprinters.com.au Most consumer SLA printers these days use bottom-up-and-peel techniques because this has some practical advantages over top-down printers Way less resin is required to fill the printer when the part is pulled out as it builds rather than being lowered into the tank along with the Z stage as it builds Resin is expensive This also means bottom up printers can be smaller and have fewer mechanical parts such as leveling devices submerged in resin Standard resins contain an inhibitor chemical that prevents polymerization in the presence of oxygen which causes the surface layer exposed to air and low-level stray light to not cure So top-down printers must shoot light through a non-curing layer before reaching curable resin This makes the tuning more sensitive and can somewhat reduce detail compared to a bottom-up printer curing right on the window Replacement vats or windows for bottom-up printers may be seen by manufacturers as a profit-generating consumable since they have to be replaced somewhat frequently Top-down printers have to worry somewhat more about resin flow rates as the part is lowered Air bubbles may be pulled into the resin or the fresh resin layer above the part may vary significantly in thickness if the part is submerged too fast for the resin viscosity Admittedly bottom-up printers will experience excessive suction forces and potentially break off bits of the print at high peel speeds CLIP is a bottom-up technique that doesn't require a peel step because the vat creates an oxygen layer over the window that keeps the resin from curing directly on the surface and sticking In that way it arguably performs more like a top-down printer than a bottom-up printer Top-down printers that are designed to overcome the above issues and use high-intensity light sources can achieve exceptionally high print speeds This includes similar continuous build techniques used as in CLIP  The number of 100x could be true in some situations I wish I could see the part(s that they printed to measure this 100x but that is another story Looking at their videos they can move the build plate at a maximum speed of 10mm per minute You will see the Eiffel tower video where they have to change over to standard speed for flat layers It is because the flat layers stop resin flow and can't be printed using continuous printing Prodways have shown that they can move it at 20mm per minute but again there are things that are not advertised/mentioned To achieve higher speeds you need to make the resins more reactive Making resins more reactive means the resins won't last as long in the vat/bottle So they expire sooner It also means they could harden under normal light conditions so it makes it difficult to work with If you look at the Prodways video you will see resin waste on the build plate That shows that the projector brightness was set too high Gizmo can print between 5 and 25 times faster than a leading brand of SLA printers also depends on the number of parts and complexity on the build plate The decision was made to advertise the build plate moving speed e.g 3mm per minute rather than the number of times faster than anything else because that is a value that doesn't change with the number of items on the build plate but it does change depending on the projection area size Imagine you just have a single line going upwards then most SLA printers could do it at the same speed B9 Creator bottom up users have actually shown they can do continuous printing when printing really tiny items with very thin walls because they don't have suction problems in those situations Now when you add many small objects with small features on the build plate DLP printers will display the full layer in one go where laser based SLA machines need to draw out each part like an FDM machine Continuous printing does have limitations Resin needs to flow from the bottom or you will get resin starvation and cause holes so you might not be able to use it for everything You should see it as another tool in your printing toolbox rather than the be all and end all So after all that the 100x depends on so many things you shouldn't get stuck at looking at that number other than knowing it is a way of marketing the printers ",

        "answers": " I wouldn't recommend drilling a hole in a 3D printed part in a traditional sense like with wood Instead I would merely ream a 3D printed part I've done this quite a bit where I'll print my holes at a slightly smaller than nominal size and use a standard carbide drill to ream the hole Things to consider Printing the holes smaller than nominal will ensure your hole is not printed larger than nominal Printing with a higher shell will ensure you can remove the material without exposing the infill Note that drilling directly into or thru an infill area of the part could lead to cracking of the part later depending on the hole's functionality In general a printed hole even if reamed will be significantly stronger than one drilled through an infill area  Have to get this out of the way Can you just print the hole into the part instead of drilling That's usually best when possible If you need to drill you'll definitely want to print an undersized hole and then ream it out with the drill This both provides alignment for the drill and adds extra plastic around the region you'll be weakening If you don't know where the hole needs to go in advance fill the model with a hex pattern of tiny holes in the general region of the future drilling This is an easy way to strengthen the area with more plastic without making the entire part solid Using a slicer that allows localized print settings will also work The hole should be aligned more or less vertical or across the grain 45 degrees aligned with the Z axis to ensure there are nice strong hoops of plastic around the hole to keep it from splitting Drilling into a printed part particularly PLA from the side parallel to the XY plane is highly likely to split it It may even be ok at first but crack later under load or due to creep Regular wood drill bits work ok but you need to go slow and take nibbles leaving the plastic time to cool so it doesn't melt and stick to the bit Coolant is an option Use a pilot hole piloted bit or step drill to remove less plastic per pass A really sharp bit will perform dramatically better than a dull bit Put something hard and drillable like wood behind the plastic part to help avoid breakage and bit-jamming when you break through the opposite side  Drilling is indeed possible but as stated in previous answers you should preferably do this along the vertical from the print bed for maximum strength and if possible use an undersized hole as a starting point/guide Drilling horizontally may cause the layers to separate but if you clamp down in the z-direction you're much more likely to succeed It's likely to start cracking if even a relatively small torque is applied one layer with bad adhesion is enough to make it surprisingly weak If you still need to apply torque from the horizontal consider reinforcing the structure in the z-direction or splitting your print and gluing/fusing the pieces together to get some strength in both directions Two holes of decent strength one along the vertical and one along the horizontal can also be achieved by adding vertical holes and bolt the layers together When drilling take care not to apply too much force and make sure the excess doesn't get stuck in the drill bit Any drill bit should work but I find that wood ones have a slight higher tendency to make the bit jam  In addition to the good answers already given I'd like to add Use a sharp drill bit and don't go too fast Dull drill bits and fast rotation are more likely to heat up the plastic especially PLA to a point where it gets soft again and then you're usually in trouble because instead of a clean round cut the material will start to bend and tear And if you allow it to cool around the drill bit well I destroyed a thread tap this way  The primary difference between drilling FDM printed plastic and wood is that the plastic part is not solid the entire way through and that plastic will melt or burn at much lower temperatures than wood If you know before printing that you're going to want to drill the part or potentially need to then you'll want to modify the design of the part such that there will be sufficient internal reinforcement and material in the location of the drill site The way I've done this in the past is put a through hole through the the entire part and slightly undersize the hole Then I also increase the number of shells on the part so that the threads will have some extra material to bite into If you know you're going to need a hole in the part but not sure where then I'd suggest using the highest level of infill possible on the print so that your part will be as close as possible to being solid plastic Or if there are a few areas you think might need to be drilled you can build your own internal structure but that can take a lot of time If you didn't know your part was going to need to be drilled AND you printed with minimal infill then be very careful about drilling and only use minimal pressure to cut through the top layer to avoid crushing the part Then once the part is drilled all the way through consider filling the part with an epoxy to reinforce the hole location if necessary Best case scenario though is knowing where and how big you need the hole to be before print Of course though specs change on the daily As for the heat generated from the drilling process I haven't had much trouble with dissipating it My method for drilling a printed part technically reaming is that after I align my hole with my drill press I then tap the drill-bit cutting only a millimeter at a time then retract wait a few seconds then repeat until all the way through A little time consuming but my reasoning is to minimize burning and overheating of the hole due to the cutting friction In all honesty I think my drilling approach is overkill But every time I've needed to do it has been due to an error in modelling I didn't have the time to reprint and was under a time crunch My post processing step therefore did not have the option to fail so I was extra careful Whether it was overkill or not it definitely worked and it's always better to be a little more cautious than late ",
        "comments": "In its current form this question might be too broad At the moment of this writing It has some close votes on it However I believe the question is useful Maybe we should split it into questions for drilling in separate materials I do think a canonical question about drilling 3D-printed plastic would be useful.This is exactly what I've done in countless parts and I've never had problems I usually shrink the diameter by a mm or so and make sure I'm doing lots of perimeters I wouldn't want to drill into infill that could get messy.",

        "answers": " From a general point of view there are a few things to consider If you buy a kit Pros You get some insurance that you have all the parts that you need to get a functional printer all the electronics structure bolts nuts screws washers wires and so on Most likely all the parts you get are made to fit together You will usually get a manual often a community that can help you out and sometimes even technical support Sometimes it can be cheaper than buying each part separately but it can also be more expensive Cons You have limited/no options to customize your printer to your own preferences without purchasing additional parts Some kits can be difficult to upgrade later or may be locked to some configuration or software My opinion The way I look at it the better option for you depends on how you want to spend your time That is If you get a kit you can spend more time building If you collect all the parts yourself you will have to spend time planning ordering parts possibly multiple times in addition to actually building the printer A possible lack of manuals could also increase the building difficulty If you don't already own a 3D printer I would recommend getting a kit simply because struggling with trivial things like parts not fitting together can take away the fun for many people  I built my first printer from scratch though it's fairly similar to an oversize MendelMax 2 It was a good learning experience but very frustrating at times Overall I think I'm glad I did it that way but a kit would have gotten me printing much faster and a bit cheaper Here are my main impressions from the experience You should already be familiar with most of the basic skills involved soldering wood and/or metal-working electronics etc And don't forget software I wrote a lot of Arduino code for various things along the way You'll need to be diligent about searching for answers online because there's no manual to go to This group should make it a lot easier now than it was last year Some problems will have great answers online some won't or the answers will be hard to piece together I found that stepper motors have a lore all their own with several subtleties I didn't expect You'll have to decide how from scratch you want to go I bought completed Arduino Mega and RAMPs boards but you could buy a kit or components for those instead or even design your own electronics altogether You'll make mistakes and spend money to recover For example my Y-axis motor couldn't move the build platform nearly fast enough too much inertia so I had to re-work that axis entirely using a much more expensive lead screw plus bearings blocks couplers If you think you might want to sell the printer later I imagine it would be easier if it's a known design That said it's a blast except when you get stuck and the satisfaction when your first successful print comes out is pretty great Oh one other hint especially for hardware buy in bulk You can probably get 100 of a certain bolt online for the price of 10 at your local hardware store Give or sell the leftovers to help others get started  A few months ago I bought a cheap 220 USD Prusa i3 kit from China and put it together Putting it together was fun and still a bit of a challenge It was also nice to have pre-configured firmware already loaded onto the Melzi board that came with it So for the downside The board Melzi that came in the kit only supports one extruder so if I want to add more extruders later I have to replace it This means that in that case I would have paid for two boards Maybe you should ask yourself what your 1 goal is If you are mostly interested in having a printer for use in other projects then a kit might be what you want If your main interest is having something to tinker with then maybe you should go all in and make everything from scratch  Three great answers have already been posted and it has been extremely interesting to read them I shall try not to repeated what has already been said I have sourced the parts separately for three different printers P3Steel the frame was a kit mind Orientation of long thin rod on P3Steel v4 Wilson II Kossel XL and Mini I have been coding Arduinos and Pis and building robots and quadcopters for a few years now Then in November 2016 because I needed a prop guard for a ZMR250 quadcopter that I found hard to obtain but easy to print I started reading about 3D printers mostly RepRap wiki and then individual blogs of straight forward builds as well as design modifications of Prusa P3Steel Wilson and Delta/Kossel printers watching countless construction videos and asking questions here on SE 3D Printers and reading other's questions and answers as well as going through eBay for hours at a time looking up parts and making numerous Bill Of Materials BOMs and blogging the information that I gleaned So this gave me a good grounding and starting point for when I did get around to ordering In fact the process is still on going After ordering the parts in December piecemeal I then had to wait for a month for the parts to arrive from China during which time I read some more and revised what I had already learned I then finally got to work on the P3Steel in January but two and a half weeks later before I had finished it I had to move to BKK for an extended period I suffered delays with the P3Steel build due to postal latency obviously but also some partial kits where missing critical parts see Is the 8mm x 20mm bearing axle for the X-axis idler of a P3Steel a custom part so I had to get them machined in Thailand because it only costs around 3 to get something machined here Hopefully when I get back to the UK I should have everything to hand and be able to finish the build in a few weeks maximum Once in Bangkok I started sourcing parts for a Wilson II and then subsequently a Kossel mostly because the aluminium and steel rods are a quarter to a half the price that they are in Europe Also I had to go through the ordering process again getting parts from China for these two printers however the parts from China only take two weeks to arrive to Thailand not a month or so for the UK The Wilson II parts I plan to take back to the UK in order to complete the build there hopefully printing the plastic parts on the P3Steel when/if the P3Steel is completed Note that seven or eight months down the line from when I first took an interest in 3D printing I still haven't completed a single printer yet However I sure as hell have learnt a lot Note most of the delay is due to the six month relocation away from my printer build in the UK Also due to my reading of the modification blogs for the Wilson and Kossel I have recently been re-purchasing upgrades before I have even fitted a bolt together for the Kossel and Wilson let alone completed either of the base builds For example I have just purchased Chinese aluminium vertices rather than the plastic PLA prints that I got from Sintron So I have ended up with a fair collection of spare redundant parts but again it has helped me gain a great insight as to what works well and what does not To reiterate that which TestGeek has said one major tip I would have is and I read this on a forum when I was first getting into 3D printer building if you are sourcing the parts separately is to buy bulk get packs of 10 pcs 50 pcs 100 pcs and buy more than you require nuts bolts bearings GT2 belt GT2 pulleys The price comes down phenomenally and you can resell the spares locally for about as much as you paid for the whole lot online thereby covering or almost covering the cost of the printer Plus spares come in handy for further builds down the road Don't buy anything from the US unless you are already in the US I guess the import/postage fees are outrageous TL;DR In the same way as you learn more from building a kit as opposed to buying a pre-built printer you will learn more sourcing the parts separately but it might cost more in redundant parts Also Research extensively first Buy bulk Be prepared for delays be patient Be prepared for an iterative design ",

        "answers": " Determine what properties you need the filament to have There are a very wide variety of filaments because they all have somewhat different properties You need to determine what properties you need your final print to possess For instance ABS can be smoothed used acetone and PLA is biodegradable More exotic filaments could be conductive or be extremely flexible Do not neglect to consider safety of the plastic in your application A full list of properties is too broad for an appropriate answer from this site Determine what you printer is designed to handle Most printers can handle PLA and ABS with little issue but higher temperatures are required to use some materials such as nylon and polycarbonate Determine beforehand what your printer is designed to handle This includes determining whether you have and appropriate heated bed or other accessories Determine what you can afford Printing not only requires the cost of the weight of filament in the final print but all of the support structures and misprints you produce Not only should you look for inexpensive filaments but you should look for ones that are good enough quality you don't waste time and money fighting problems with the raw material All in all this will vary case by case I would recommend that you start with PLA or ABS as they are common and relatively easy to work with but that you do your own research into what each individual filament type has to offer ",

        "comments": "They exist Blender for one An exhaustive list is off topic here.Please note that STL as a file type is not designed to be edited and is susceptible to corruption if brought

times.Hi Leo I have downvoted your question and here is why stating that There is no argument that strongly indicates that you cover up your own personal opinion as a fact something that is frowned upon in the SE community I suggest you either back up this statement or find a somewhat more humble reformulation.I don't care if it strongly indicates that it is my own personal opinion in your opinion Statistically Blender is successful in all areas which are feature completeness stability siz eof community help popularity download count number of users development phase These are statistics/facts Whether my own opinion is also involved or not is even irrelevant at this point So if you're going to downvote an answer which might be the best option for the person asking the question the whole purpose of Q&A for the sake of the spirit of SE then go ahead I simply find that illogical.please understand me correctly I am not saying Blender isn't a great software and perhaps the best alternative in this case However there is no argument that there are other 3D editors that can edit STL files as well see what I did there In other words I'm not disagreeing with you but simply asking if you would consider rephrasing it Whether you do or not is entirely up to you but I believe your answer will be better if worded differently.Blender is successful and I'm not debating that My question wasn't meant to instill a pissing match That said Blender is really more oriented at animation and editing models for 3D printing is kind of a hack being that it is geometry is unit-less Hence one can model proportionally but then you have to scale to the real world outside of Blender.Tormod please understand that I'm not talking like this because of my emotions nor am I a fan of the software Blender I'm just stating what I believe to be a fact I see no reason to reword what I said simply because I believe what I said to be true I don't think this is the situation where one needs to not seem biased or sound humble As I mentioned there are facts to back up what I said Please understand that what you said about what SE community likes is also simply your opinion which I can disagree with No pissing match here.Jim Blender is a 3d modeller which has taken a generalist approach like many other 3d modellers meaning that it can do many things it is not design specifically for one task I can tell you with 100 certainty that Blender is not more oriented at animation making Like I said it's a general 3d modeller And geometry is not unitless you can choose Metric or Imperial mode in this menu http i.imgur.com/D1mdhDy.png By default it is none or Blender Units which is more useful for other things when you're better off thinking in relative dimensions rather than real world units.Continued there is also an addon for people who use it for 3d printing which is included with Blender now http wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Modeling/PrintToolbox Not that it is necessary but there's even that.I'm not sure about that Sounds more like there being different revisions of the format and/or some 3d editors not creating the files properly which other 3d editors with more strict parsing will not load than a limitation of a format Personally I've created as well as edited STL files in Blender and used them in Repetier Host and I've never had an issue loading a file in both.@LeoErvin I was trying to convey the issues of 3D editors not importing/exporting properly as you said Look into the following Wikipedia page as one of my sources https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format For a program like Blender which can heavily rely on proper orientation of the triangulated solid it is understandable that you haven't encountered an issue However there are other not as well developed applications that may choose to ignore or not use certain parameters within the file as they are not within scope of the application So just be careful which software you use.@LeoErvin just edited your answer to help maintain integrity to the political correctness of your response.Sorry I could not approve that as in the link there was no statistical data just mention that it has 3d printing tools built-in @LeoErvin I'm sorry for my own negative response to your question For some reason the formulation provoked me which it probably shouldn't have.@Tormod Haugene No problem I believe political correctness is overused these days for a Q&A site I just don't see a place for it as I think it will both make the questions and the answers longer and therefore less readable that's why I write like this Now if you asked me to mention some sources to my claims that would be reasonable to me.@LeoErvin I guess I'm more of the scientific writer type where you never make a claim without backing it up without at least 5 references As someone who's in the 3d field I know almost everyone here knows what the major 3d modellers are capable of Max Maya Blender C4D etc but we don't keep bookmarks to the things which led us to learn that I'll try to dig up the facts.@LeoErvin The link that I tried to add to your response was a SE link which is preferred over another website link Did you have a look at the link in the posted question It leads to an article providing sound statistical evidence that Blender is most used in the 3D printing community.Only a link that Blender has some tools for 3d printer users Not a link that Blender is the most successful FOSS 3d editor which was what some people didn't like FOSS means free and open source not about 3d printing Good point mentioning OpenSCAD When downloading from Thingiverse editing the scad files directly is nice solution if you know how to use it.+1 for Meshmixer love doing small fixes with it It can't rescue everything but it is certainly unique in its approach to modifying files much more akin to literal sculpting than anything else I've used Fusion360 often has issues with complex STL files since it doesn't natively work in the STL format so files have to be converted to the Fusion language OpenSCAD isn't a bad solution however tweaking parts is a bit challenging as there isn't a way AFAIK to measure an existing object to offset and tweak accordingly.Wow this is actually pretty well maintained surprisingly I will need to try this out As a software dev myself I'm intrigued just because it's written in Erlang For those looking for the site http www.wings3d.comIf you have programming background OpenSCAD is easy but read up on the unusual scope rules but if the original author was drawing in a GUI instead of coding it may be hard to get any useful human-readable code out of their models and into OpenSCAD Models of people terrains etc are likely to be done with a GUI like Blender engineered parts are likely to be done with OpenSCAD.",

        "answers": " IMHO your best bet is to use some kind of a tape I do not have any experience with robo3dprinter but I have been using glass with PET tape on in for past 4 years I have seen guys using Kapton tape as well Never tried The main disadvantage on this solution is increasing the bed thickness I am not sure if you are able to tinker with the Z level endstop in case not this migh be an issue The other solution you can try is replace your bed with piece of glass and then apply PET tape or any other kind I am also not sure if you are able to replace the bed print surface of not When using glass and PET tape you need to get the surface of PET tape rough using sand paper and you might have to apply so called Acetone Juice to make sure that your ABS prints will stick to the bed Acetone juice is basically Aceton with disolved piece of Natural ABS plastic this created sticky layer on your bed that helps to hold your prints on the bed while printing  A little chip is fine but I wouldn't print with that big of a crack However that doesn't mean you need to spend 80 on a new sheet of glass Option 1 If you want borosilicate glass you can get a sheet from either McMaster about 40+shipping for a 10\"x10 piece less for smaller or from a local glass maker the price varies a lot so you should check that also if you want to go that route However you won't be able to drill holes tempered glass will break of you drill a hole Borosilicate glass has the advantage of being extremely heat-resistant so it won't break from thermal expansion If you go this route you should pick up a few binder clips also to attach the sheet to the heated bed Option 2 You might be able to get picture frame glass from a hardware store It's super cheap mine was 3 or something from lowes and they'll often cut it to exact size You might be able to drill this but you have to be extremely careful Sometimes the hardware store can drill holes in the sheet for you if needed If you don't want to drill a few binder clips will work just as well Just a note for if you are using binder clips you might need to depending on how your hbp is set up get a piece of glass that is slightly smaller to allow for any bed leveling screws to have room If you're going with the picture frame glass you should make sure that the glass will be entirely within the heated part so that there isn't any heat gradient that's how glass cracks/shatters  Replacing your bed is the safest option especially if you have a heated bed Cracks and chips in the glass create an uneven surface for your prints and can become a safety hazard additionally while borosilicate glass is very resistant to thermal shock it can continue to crack or shatter when subjected to rapid/uneven temperature variations after damage Borosilicate glass tends to break in large pieces rather than shattering snap instead of splintering but it's still a safety hazard It sounds like you have the Kickstarter version of the Robo3D R1 the current glass bed on the Robo3D uses magnets to hold the bed in place so you'd probably need to replace your Y axis rails along with the bed I would contact Robo3D support to see what options you have available for upgrading the bed and rails through them Aside from Robo3D you have a few options If you plan to continue using the bed Kapton tape is an effective surface application for general printing It's very thin but provides an effective surface for ABS amp PLA adherence works with heated beds and is compatible with secondary adherence items blue masking tape PVA glue ABS slurry etc Kapton tape can be damaged after several prints so plan on having several sheets on hand You can replace your current borosilicate glass with a new sheet of borosilicate glass from a secondary source Aluminum plates are an effective replacement Lexan sheets also make an effective replacement but I wouldn't recommend applying heat to them  If your heatbed itself is aluminum/copper/other metal Get a glass cut and replace it The current one is probably attached to the heatbed with adhesive glue If it the adhesive is cyanocrylate based you can remove by rubbing with acetone If silicone type it will come off by some force Don't worry you won't damage aluminum THe heating element is either inside the aluminum or under it If it's not alumunum it's likely a PCB heatbed Then I wouldn't suggest to use acetone or some antiglue and would just try to apply a little force and see if the glass moves a bit If no don't bother PCB heatbeds can break too Then I'd just suggest to apply some epoxy to cover

that your best bet is to replace the glass entirely But short of that you might try something like Loctite Glass glue which is essentially crazy glue for glass Be sure to level and clamp well while drying or you'll end up with it permanently not straight of course You'd want it clamped to a very flat surface and clamped pushing the broken edges together But I think I'd just replace it ",
        "comments": "Hi Arden Does the glass stick to the heated bed somehow or could you potentially replace the broken glass without also replacing the heated bed?It appears that on this model the heating element is part of some adhesive that is attached straight to the glass printing bed There is a possibility that I might be able to remove it but not a chance that I want to takeThat was the solution that I have been using in the past but I wanted to eliminate the necessary price for purchasing new tape If I am unable to find a solution for the glass bed then that is what I will return to using And I am able to adjust the Z level end stop Thank you for the suggestions of different kinds of tape I have been using blue painters tape and that has a fairly hefty price tag sometimes.Thanks for the suggestion I am waiting for their reply on the request for replacement part And if that doesn't work then I will look into the Kapton tape.@ArdenRasmussen I see Honestly I am not really su that you can fix the broken glass anyhow You better prepare for replacing it either for original one or just one cutted from nearby glassmaker Does your maschine at least allow you to position your print where ever you want Or do you have to print from middle Have you tried to apply warranty in matter of this issue?NP You should also think about adding a piece of cork over that heating element it'll help insulate the coil and improve the heating of the bed.If it's cyanocrylate based you can always remove the glue with acetone if it ends up uneven.",

just to be a controller Another great example is this app Apps have menus that can arrange everything for you now it depends on what app do you use and what filament you use It's very simple thing  My printer IdeaWerk 150 is very basic and doesn't have any options for this from the screen I wrote a really simple GCODE file that brings the nozzle up to temperature then runs the extruder for a few seconds then waits then extrudes for a bit again I think it does this 3 or 4 times then stops I can put the file when converted to x3g onto an SD card and run it whenever I need it I have a similar file that allows me to level the bed without a computer by just moving the nozzle around to a few key points on the bed and pausing for a few seconds I used a GCODE file generated by my slicer in

of start.txt If I feed just this file into my printer it will heat up the nozzle bring the bed up to about 10cm below printing height and once the nozzle is at temperature it turns on the extruder for 8 seconds Your printer will likely be different to mine there are a few different flavours of GCODE and you will likely have different XYZ positions so take a look at some GCODE generated by your own slicer and identify the different parts The principle is the same  RepRap based printers use LCD modules with control button and SD card You can trigger operations like nozzle heating to change filament extrude filament home axis to caliber bed level Most used LCD modules are RepRapDiscount Full Graphic Smart Controller RepRapDiscount Smart Controller see video RepRap firmwares Marlin Repetier are supporting it To get better view on what is supported take a look on Marlin language file  I have two different printers that can print un-tethered The first is a Prusa inspired machine with an LCD and the second is a printrbot without an LCD The reprap machine uses a ramps 1.4 board programmed with Marlin that gives me the ability to control loading and unloading of the filament with simple menus Not all printers that have the ability to print from SD come with an LCD screen My printrbot simple metal does not come with an LCD it is an additional 100 I am too cheap to buy one so I came up with an extremely low tech way of changing filament I turn my printer on with an SD card that has an auto0.g file this tells the board to load and run g-code on start-up once the printer starts to move I kill the power remove the filament and put new filament into the extruder I then press the lever to disengage the extruder motor and force the new filament into the hot end until the old color has been purged Please note this method only works when you are replacing materials that have the same printing temperatures  By a pretty large margin the most popular primary control via LCD printers such as the FlashForge Creator line and Makerbot Replicator 1/2/2x run Sailfish firmware which has options for all necessary control functions directly from the LCD Preheat load unload level bed etc are all done via the LCD and seamlessly built-in scripts There is no need to connect host software to do anything but update firmware and change rarely-adjusted settings like acceleration parameters RepRap-style USB control of Sailfish printers is perfectly functional but not really necessary 99.9 of the time This is a major reason why Sailfish printers have historically been popular for printer farms They're designed for stand-alone operation which is highly favorable when the printers greatly outnumber the associated computers It's extremely rare to see a Sailfish printer from the last 5 years without a 5-button LCD panel The Sailfish firmware UI/UX is simply built around the LCD buttons rather than host software This is generally more reliable and higher-performance than say Marlin via host because it reduces processor time spent on command transmission and eliminates all the possible failure modes in the PC and USB link Assuming all Sailfish printers will have LCDs with SD card support and focusing on that one interface really allowed the creation of an overall better printer More optimization fewer things that need to be configured by the end-user But in exchange you're limited in what kind of hardware Sailfish will support It's a tradeoff In comparison LCD support was more strapped onto RepRaps as an option rather than the core interface element This tends to produce a host-driven interface design rather than an LCD-driven interface design Which is why operating headless tends to be more difficult in Marlin Repetier etc  I know that my RoBo 3D has the ability to run untethered once the gcode file is saved to the SD card attached to the ramps board It does have to be attached to the computer to start the print at first but can then be unplugged from your computer Since it is just a Marlin based Ramps printer this should work for similar 3D printers The gcode files contain the temperature of both the nozzle and the heated bed if you have one The Marlin firmware will prime the temperatures for you Changing filament you would still need to set your hot end temp to swap in the new filament with a computer over USB though Now I personally use something called OctoPi which is a raspberry pi distribution preconfigured with Octoprint OctoPrint allows you to control the printer monitor or start prints over a web interface and even stream video to watch your prints if you want While technically you printer is still tied to a computer(raspberry pi it does not tie up the use of your laptop/desktop while printing Plus this would allow you to put your 3D printer in more locations in your home as well OctoPrint Website http octoprint.org For the OctoPi distribution http octoprint.org/download  You don't need a specific menu for this although some printers are more able than others to do the following procedure just play with the filament loading procedure Although better print qualities are given by sticking if possible to the same color and filament when you have to flush out any trace get an ABS filament of the most neutral color possible getting a spool dedicated to this task might be a good idea load the neutral ABS at 250 degrees or higher and let it extrude freely and quickly for at least 1 meter if you need to clean more extrude at least 3 meters Note if you can't get ABS the best option you can use PLA but results may vary if you can't get neutral color absence or almost no color pigment white is the best choice otherwise black Neutral color is best by far for obvious reasons

        "answers": " I don't have dual extruder printer myself but to my understanding having both nozzles leveled at the same height is critical for getting successful prints For typical FDM printers the lowest point of the end effector should always be the nozzle If you for instance mount a fan lower than the tip of your nozzle it will eventually collide with the printed object The effect of having unequally leveled nozzle tips for a dual extruder printer will be exactly the same one of the nozzles will either drag against or collide with the model during print or one of the nozzles will be to far away from the model giving poor layer adhesion Either way the result will be sub-optimal So leveling both nozzles equally is probably a good idea You might want to have a look at this question on some advice regarding how to do it  If your printer has no way to move the heads up and down or otherwise out of the way and your slicer isn't able to detect collisions and account for head height differences in the produced G code then they must be at exactly the same height from the bed If extruder A is hanging lower than extruder B then when B has printed at a certain level and A moves across that area A will hit the material B has printed Unfortunately this is further complicated for newer printers because some of them rely on digital bed leveling If your bed isn't parallel to your X and Y axis movement then you have to work very hard to make sure the heads are parallel to the bed and with some mechanisms this isn't possible without making the mechanism itself parallel to the bed so just mounting the new head at the same height as the other head might not be sufficient if your printer isn't perfectly calibrated already I have not yet seen a printer or slicer that manages heads of different heights but I suppose it's possible to manage the problem with additional intelligence For instance if the printer can move the heads up and down independently it might move one down for printing and the other up and out of the way when it's not printing and then the opposite when it switches I can't think of a good reason to do this though Another option would be to develop a slicer to generate G-Code that will prevent such collisions The printer would necessarily be limited in what it could print depending on the location of the second head as there are some situations where it would need to print in a certain area but a collision prevents it from getting to that area At any rate no one has developed such software or mechanisms yet so if you had good reason to mount the heads at different heights you'd have to account for all of these factors and develop the complete solution yourself  I have a dual extruder Replicator 1 and having the nozzles at the same height is a must and albeit a bit of a struggle otherwise At one point I had to disassemble my extruder head and the nozzles didn't line up quite right There after printing with the lower one obviously didn't have any troubles however printing with the high extruder made it so the lower extruder would scrape the molten plastic layer This made my surface finish horrible and almost impossible for support structures to be printed Instead of fighting with my stock nozzle assembly to get everything perfectly lined up I just shimmed the one side with some stacks of paper cutouts This brought my extruders very close to even Also you'll want to make sure excess plastic is cleaned off of BOTH nozzles when printing with either nozzle I found that some prints would fail because of a small discharge from a previous print on the other nozzle  To add to the above answers besides the obvious point that one hotend might collide with something another hotend positioned lower than it has printed you also want both hotends to be positioned X microns above the bed at minimum height so your filament will stick to the bed properly Position one a bit higher than the other and what it prints won't stick to the bed very well position one a bit lower and it will hit the bed and clog/be unable to print the first layer The only reason I can think of when you'd want one hotend to be higher is a situation when you're not using both hotends and don't want the second hotend to drag on and deform a layer the main hotend has printed and is still warm and deformable If that's an issue I doubt then sure move it a bit higher If there are other reasons for what you would like to have the hotends at different heights please add that to your question I can't think of one myself ",

        "answers": " The easiest way I know of unless your printer has a Z-probe and automatic leveling is to bring the nozzle(s down fairly close to the bed maybe 1/4 or so and then move it around while watching for anyplace that doesn't look even Adjust the bed until it seems even You can just eyeball it or use a ruler or object to measure Then bring the nozzle down closer and repeat Each time you move it closer you'll be able to eyeball more accurately Once you're quite close pull out a 3x5 card or business card or similar and move the nozzle up or down until the card just fits between the nozzle and the bed with no great pressure but no space either Again move the head all around the bed and do any remaining tiny adjustments so it's the same everywhere Of course if the bed is at all warped this will be much harder or even impossible So before starting put a good-quality straightedge along it to make sure it's actually flat  There are several ways 1 Simplest is the business card/paper method This video shows how simple it is Leveling the platform You should feel the same amount of resistance between the hotend and the bed on all sides On some 3D printers there are 3 screws holding the bed eg Solidoodle and on others there are 4 screws on each edge e.g Prusa i3 On some 3D printers you need to rotate a screw with a screwdriver to adjust it e.g Solidoodle 3 and on some you have a nut mostly wing nut e.g Solidoodle 4 I find most people move the extruder around when adjusting the bed by controlling the motors I think the quicker way is stopping the motors in Repetier Host it's the Stop Motor button and moving the gantry by hand Tutorial 3D printing guides Bed leveling 2 Second one is just more advanced version of the above You use a dial indicator micrometer attached to your extruder and make sure the number on the dial is as close as possible on all edges Level the Print Bed on a RepRap RepStrap 3D Printer with a Mitutoyo Dial Test Indicator Micrometer op 3D printer There are also digital versions of this tool You might need to print or make some other way a piece to be able to attach a micrometer to the extruder there might be one for your 3D printer on Thingiverse already Now remember I mentioned that you adjust the height of the edges of the print bed with a screw/nut Well since there is a lot of vibration during print those tend to get out of place and that might explain why you end up readjusting it over and over again What I have found to solve this is to use a single drop of Loctite cyanocrylate glue in the middle of the nut/screw A single drop will secure it in place but also not make it impossible to unscrew in the future 3 Setting up auto-bed leveling on your 3D printer if it's modable enough 3D printing guides Setting up auto bed tramming leveling tilt compensation Finally if you can't get the bed leveled no matter what it might be uneven That's usually caused by warping Both PCB beds and aluminum beds can get warped With the former just sandwich a glass bed on top of it and it should be fine Warped aluminum is pretty hard to flatten In this extreme situation you might need to get a new aluminum sheet cut and drilled preferably a mm thicker one which is less likely to warp under the same conditions I think this happens when you either set the bed temp too high and/or the thickness of the aluminum bed is too small bad or cheap 3D printer design  If you don't have an auto-leveling build plate or a depth gauge attachment for your X-Axis you're pretty much stuck with the piece of paper method To perform this easier try shifting the paper as you adjust the bed As soon as the paper becomes difficult to move the nozzle is touching now back off the build plate by about a quarter turn Please also keep in mind how your printer is constructed If your build plate arms are plastic they are easily susceptible to warping if you have a heated build plate Even if the warping isn't permanent the build plate can technically shift during a print as the arms get hotter Some people go as far as replacing these arms with aluminum versions  After the first leveling I usually don't need to touch it for long time even if my bed structure is of wood and could warp in time I guess you need to adjust it because you turn on the heating and in the meanwhile do the leveling Do it when the bed is hot and stable for 5 minutes and you'll see it will stay correct between prints Keep in mind that in my case the temperature changes the position of the extruder as well do the leveling when everything is hot even if without filament inserted Edit if you print both ABS and PLA a single leveling done at an intermediate temperature will be enough Also be sure that the screws don't move due to vibrations I used a foam washer to keep them in position It warps during the first hours of application and then provides good friction ",

        "comments": "Hi What kind of printer do you have Is your y-axis a moving print bed?+1 for the note about no positional feedback This is so frustrating you spend sometimes thousands of dollars on a machine that doesn't know where it is.@tbm0115 that is very true indeed I am hoping for that to change as the treaty printing technology matures!Added to post RepRap and yes it is the bed.I thought I heard somewhere that the NEMA motors have a way to know which step they're on but the controllers only interact with the motors in increments There might be a way to at least create some form of endstop that recognizes the stepper is out of sync and pauses/stops the machine.The belts being not too tight can be the problem If I don't tighten my belts the belt slips off the motor What sounds does it make when it skips Also how much force does the bed require to move?I believe most stepper motors only have an open loop control which means that they don't know their own position However a closed loop control with positional feedback is usually not needed since they have excellent precision and torque as long as the motor is properly scaled for their application Also for some applications unlike in 3D printing skipping steps doesn't really matter You could add an encoder to the shaft for providing positional feedback And just like you say some steppers also come with such encoders integrated.@tbm0115 Some stepper drivers can detect skipped steps by sensing variations in the current going to the motor However NEMA motors don't have a way to know what step they're on There are no electronics inside just some coils and magnets.Something else that I have also run into that can cause skipping is the filament not spooling smoothly.I know it's an answer to a somewhat different question than you've asked but one thing you can do to mitigate axis slippage until you can figure out what's causing it is to home the X and Y axes between each layer This will guarantee that if you slip during one layer only that layer is off and the next layer will be lined up correctly again.worn out/low quality linear bearings and rods they slide on can contribute to 4 7 and 8.FYI the way stepper motors work is they are always on so being pretty warm when even not rotating is normal That said they can skip steps if too hot so adding a 4cm heatsink+fan is worth it and isn't hard or expensive.The motors can also be skipping step simply from overheatingI had the same problem on my Mendel and it turned out that speed and acceleration were too high But as amra said there are a lot of thiings that can cause this problem.Hello Matt Clark I noticed your question has been up for a while now Have any of the answers below been able to solve your question If so would you mind accepting the appropriate answer If not what is missing so that we may help you further Also if you have figured it out on your own you can always answer and accept your own solution Thank you.",

        "comments": "Just to note you can get foil tape to use auto leveling with glassIt seems that this can be mostly mitigated by getting quality aluminium 3+mm thickness and ensuring that the entire plate is heated evenly Thoughts?Interesting Do you have a link handy to the exact kind of foil tape you are referencing?How does the foil tape affect adhesion?On the other hand many 3d printers have an aluminum bed then a glass on top of the aluminum.I can't recommend an exact one but anything that's conductive should work I got the recommendation from here http m.instructables.com/id/Enable-Auto-Leveling-for-your-3D-Printer-Marlin-Fi Some people just use aluminum foil Most likely it would go on the corners or under the bed so adhesion shouldn't matter Alternatively you can use a contact sensor such as the BLTouch which is material independent.@LeoErvin,Chase Very good points I have updated the answer.The guys who make the DeltaPrintr have found a pretty neat solution to auto calibration where they put pressure sensors at each foot of the bed Although not as straightforward to use with normal printer firmware it means that you no longer need any specific mechanism on the end effector itself http deltaprintr.com/shop/3d-printers/deltaprintr-kit/hairsrpay or abs slurry is the way to go with bare glass and ABS Or PET tape or Kapton tape on it The latters also work with bare aluminum but not sure about the former.Don't forget about glass and painters tape for PLA.How to setup up auto bed tramming leveling tilt compensation using inductive sensor and aluminium bed https youtu.be/EcGFLwj0pnA?t=106Also some say with glass you have less uniform heat distribution I don't think that's a problem myself and maybe it has to do with not having a ful size or uniform heating element in the first place.I print directly on my heated aluminium bed with glue stick on it It works well for PLA not tried with ABS The bed shape don't change 3 mm thick but it's a Delta with a small diameter I've got a nice surface finish.Hi welcome to the site The question asks for a comparison between aluminium and glass Your answer seems to only focus on aluminium If you have any experience printing on glass you might include that in your answer as well as in its current state it doesn't really address the question.Basically having an homogeneous temperature on a aluminium bed is impossible or possible only at ONE temperature the sides are losing heat more than the center it's inevitable You can have a non-homogeneous heating below it tuned to heat more on the sides but it would be optimal only for a specific temperature the one for which you designed the heating path below One compromise would be to heat only the circumference maybe a sort of ring 3mm wide so that the center is always slightly colder and it is pulled apart/stretched by the sides At least it will not bend up/down.If your glass has nothing on it than your stated method of taking the temperature is not accurate due to emissivity of materials Basically the sensor is going to read the temperature of what is reflected off the glass and not the actual temperature of the glass You need to coat the glass in something non-reflective to get an accurate temperature or use something that contacts the glass physically See here for more information http www.raytek.com/raytek/en-r0/ireducation/emissivityHere is a picture that demonstrates the above http blog.brixandersen.dk/wp-content/uploads/IR003969.jpg If you notice the axial resistor which according to the scale is 300C but the block around it is showing a much lower temperature because it's brass and reflective You'll also notice the tip is showing 200C this is because it more than likely has plastic smeared on the outside.@tjb1 The emmisivity of glass is much higher than that of aluminium or brass The measurement should be fairly accurate It doesn't have anything to do with reflections the amount of infrared radiation emitted by an object depends on its material and its temperature Smooth metal surfaces happen to have low emmisivity i.e do not give off much radiation and thus are not read accurately on the other hand glass has rather high emmisivity and should work fine.Could this be reworded As it stands right now it's not answering the question being askedHave you tried to match the temperature in between the heatbed thermistor and your optical thermometer It might be the case that the thermistor does not yield the same temperature as the thermometer for the same temperature That might also influence the difference you notice in temperatures.",

        "answers": " The main issue with very narrow extrusion widths less than the nozzle size is that you get really poor nozzle squash The plastic isn't pressed down very hard as it's extruded That causes poor layer bonding and weaker prints The flow of molten plastic coming out of the nozzle must be drawn down by tension in order to end up smaller than the nozzle opening and that drawing effect makes it difficult to get good contact with the previous layer So you end up with a stack of logs structure kind of like this This photo actually shows layer height extrusion width nozzle size which is another no-no but the end result is similar What you want instead is something very mashed together and strong like this How finely the the strand can draw down versus smearing or breaking apart into blobs will depend greatly on the type of filament and the printing conditions For example nylon draws down extremely well because it experiences a large degree of strain crystallization and actually gets stronger and stiffer as it's stretched PLA tends to get more brittle when strained and may break into stringy blobs ABS doesn't change terribly much because it's highly amorphous Polymer type blending agents print speed printing temperature and cooling will control the drawing behavior of the filament Another factor to consider is what the strand spacing is within the print If you set the extrusion width equal to half the nozzle width depending on the slicer adjacent strands may be placed with pitch equal or slightly less than half the nozzle width So after the first strand is printed say an unimportant inner perimeter the next strand will be printed with the nozzle partially overlapping the previous strand This effectively creates a constriction to force the plastic out of a smaller opening to one side of the nozzle which is not too different from printing with a smaller nozzle Subsequent perimeter strands may then tend to heal up even if the first is low quality This effect doesn't completely fix the problem but it helps account for why under-width strands seem to work better than they ought to Of course even if the strands turn out ok it's arguable whether there is any benefit If the goal of a smaller extrusion width is more precision and sharper corners you may not actually accomplish that goal When the filament is being drawn down by tension in the cooling polymer it may tend to cut corners and get pulled into a rounded arc when the nozzle changes direction That may defeat the point of using a thinner extrusion width in the first place Generally I only recommend using under-width strands to capture thin-wall detail that is only a little bit too thin for the nozzle not as a way to improve overall print quality In comparison having the extrusion width equal or wider than the nozzle ensures the plastic is firmly squished downward into intimate contact with the lower layer You can fudge this a bit and still get decent results but it's usually best to keep the extrusion width equal or larger than the nozzle size There's no hard cutoff where it will won't work ",

        "answers": " Layer Times See my answer to this question and pay particular attention to my suggestion about a minimum layer print time I'm not sure if all slicing engines provide this option but I know MakerWare/MakerBot Desktop and possibly Slic3r allow this setting Basically when you're extruding smaller features like this the previous layer(s are still very hot and possibly very pliable So as your nozzle moves around above the previous layer the nozzle may and probably will push some of this molten plastic around Chances are you can see it to a certain degree while it's printing You can definitely see this in a most drastic state if you print a tall and small diameter cylinder You'll notice that the part will become almost exponentially unstable the higher it goes By increasing the time your printer takes to print a single layer you are allowing the previous layer(s to cool closer to the ambient temperature of the build space and hopefully not as molten Please refer to this calculator or a similar one for material cooling times For a standard shell setting of about 2-3 0.4mm nozzle will yield about 130sec to cool down to room temperature I would recommend for ABS/PLA at least about a 15second minimum for each layer possibly longer depending on the size and spread out of the features Also note that this can be cheated by simply printing multiple items in the same build plate with the same heights ie multiples of the same part Naturally it will take longer for the machine to print the rest of the parts and therefore allow each layer to cool slightly before being printed over Active Cooling Again some slicing engines have an Active Cooling setting I don't personally have this option setup on my machine but I believe it regulates the flow of air directed at your nozzle usually by use of a mounted fan This can help cool the layers a bit faster With ABS this might result in some pretty bad warping mid-print Feedrates Try bringing down your feedrates to provide the printed portions of the current layer more time to cool if the above options aren't available Note that you might also bring down your hotend temp to shorten the time it takes to cool the plastic All else fails My only other suggestion is stated above try printing duplicates on the same plate My diagnosis is that the previous layers aren't cooling down enough before the next layer begins  I believe you might be having an issue with insufficient cooling Remember the suggestion to have wait times per layer to let the previous layer cool Well I think with your setup and print not only do individual layers overheat but individual parts of each layer You either need to try more direct or dual fan cooling or maybe use a nozzle with thinner outer diameter which will have less surface to heat the layed down plastic surrounding it  Your extrusion temperature may be too high ",

        "answers": " Generally AVR is in fact less powerful than many ARM cores used today Most printers with AVRs don't have floating-point coprocessors although a lot of the step and movement control can be done in integer-only math except for G2/G3 Marlin can interrupt for step handling up to 10000 times per second on AVR translating to 40000 steps per second This isn't particularly useful without mechanical components that can move at those speeds and still print meaningful results or are far more precise and have a far higher step-count-per-mm at a similar speed Graphic display isn't a particularly taxing thing to do at low speeds high speeds or weird interfaces might require a bit more power or a dedicated interrupt The times when ARM might be important are for more math-heavy and especially floating-point-heavy setups such as delta where every move requires many floating-point and trig operations and navigation in menus on a 16MHz AVR atmega2560 is described as painfully slow but Marlin does succeed in printing meaningful results on delta-style printers Clearly an ARM core that is either faster at performing soft floating-point or supports hardfloat hardware that does floating point operations very efficiently will see a benefit for such processes  Generally microcontrollers such as the AVR are single core single threaded so while working in a while loop to run the motor controller you might be lacking resources to do anything else like navigate a menu efficiently Many ARM processors now a days are multi core multi threaded meaning that you can have one thread working your print while another is free for whatever else the user may want to do i.e Any AVR processor running a local webserver to allow remote access to the printer would be painfully basic where ARM would generally allow for much more flexibility  AVR processor has sufficient performance for standard printing But it lacks performance for delta printers see hexafraction answer display menu it's terribly slow on my RepRap printer which uses ATmega2560 web interface ethernet Comparison of technical specs should be self explaining This particular ARM CPU is at least 10x faster opposite to ATmega2560 CPU ARM-Cortex M3 LPC1769 used in Smoothieboard CPU Cortex-M3 1 core architecture ARMv7-M 32-bit frequency 96-120 Mhz memory Flash 512 kB RAM 64 kB Microcontroller ATmega2560 architecture 8-bit frequency 16 MHz memory flash Memory 256 KB of which 8 KB used by bootloader SRAM 8 KB EEPROM 4 KB  3D printer controllers have to do a lot of stuff very very fast Performing kinematics and dynamics calculations while sending many thousands of precisely-synchronized step pulses per second is really really hard The 8bit AVR line of microcontrollers used in older 3D printer controllers is basically a late-1990s era Mr Coffee processor They are completely utterly maxed out on processor time just executing basic printing functions in simple eg Cartesian printers and adding additional calculation load will bog them down and cause slowdowns stuttering pausing and so on But my 8bit printer works fine you say No it doesn't Your print performance is limited by it whether you realize it or not Slicers now automatically hide a lot of the firmware's performance shortcomings from you For example the standard practice of greatly slowing down print speeds on perimeters is largely a result of 8bit processors having inadequate resources for two things Performing centripetal acceleration calculations for curves across multiple gcode segments Keeping up with gcode transmission/processing and motion planning for gcode with lots of very small segments such as in organic models or smooth arcs When presented with a series of very small segments in a smooth arc or complex curve the 8bit firmware will likely choke on the required command processing rate and introduce stuttering to the print These incredibly brief pauses allow residual pressure in the extruder to push out some extra plastic making a little zit on the print So most slicers automatically decimate curves and output gcode with reduced resolution to lighten the load on the firmware Problem solved right But there's another issue the GRBL motion control algorithms underlying all the major open source 3D printer controllers were designed with lots of shortcuts and hacks to allow 8bit processors to execute fast enough For example the basic algorithm only looks at the speed or velocity change at the corner between two segments and uses that to decide when to decelerate/accelerate along the direction of motion It does not calculate or consider centripetal/radial acceleration whatsoever This is a really effective hack when printing boxy low-res models but it fails miserably on smooth curves with lots of little segments The firmware does not detect any appreciable velocity change at the corner of any two nearly-linear segments within the faceted curve and thus does not slow down for the curve So complex geometry is effectively printed at constant velocity with no acceleration Printing complex perimeters unaccelerated means the commanded feedrate must be very low to get good quality Most printers are limited to about 40mm/s or less on complex perimeters despite being able to run perhaps 80-120mm/s on low-complexity infill before hitting other speed limits Between the command processing rate limits and motion planner shortcomings required by low power processors print speeds must be much lower in practice than is strictly required by the physics and printer hardware This all comes from 8bit processors The workarounds and best practices to deal with this problem are so deeply baked into the toolchains and ecosystem that very few people realize there is even a problem But it's a real limit that can be overcome a high-speed processor running a more rigorous motion planner could generate higher average print speeds with better print quality That said the ARM-based firmwares are only slowly moving towards more advanced motion planners This is a big development area right now that is actually driving an upcoming shift away from low-end ARMs like the Cortex M3 towards even faster processors It's actually not all that hard to max out an 84 MHz Arduino Due by piling on a bunch of firmware features The use of 8bit processors also makes printers LOUDER The biggest consumer of processor time in a typical 8bit printer is the stepper interrupt that fires the step pulses to make the motors move It is quite typical for 60 of all clock cycles on an Atmega AVR to go to firing step pulses Because this occurs as an interrupt other processing tasks that the printer must perform like acceleration calculations and heater control get squeezed into the brief spaces between stepper interrupt events Without careful firmware design the step pulses will completely crowd out other functionality like LCD display updates and acceleration calculations In order to allow higher motion rates without using all the processor resources 8bit firmwares have a mode called step doubling that fires two or four or eight step pulses per stepper interrupt so that half or a quarter or an eighth as many stepper interrupts can be used to produce the same motion speed This practice de-bottlenecks the processor but it causes rougher and louder motor motion because the step pulses are fired in bursts rather than a constant frequency In effect the microstepping level of the motor is functionally dropped to a coarser mode when the stepper interrupt fires double or quad steps So the motors get louder less precise and in extreme cases may have problems with resonance An interesting side effect is that if you switch a Marlin-based printer from 1/16 microstepping to 1/32 microstepping and keep the same print speeds the firmware will simply start step-doubling dropping your effective microstepping level right back down to 1/16 ARM-based firmwares also use step doubling but the allowable step rates are typically 8 times higher before double/quad stepping is used That can mean higher speeds and/or smoother motion Another issue with 8bit AVRs is the lack of hardware floating point and need to spend many clock cycles on high-precision calculations or handling very large numbers Delta kinematics auto-leveling functions calculating moves with extremely high step counts for large printers and other advanced functionality all take a lot of clock cycles on an 8bit processor Poor firmware design or carelessly adding a feature that requires a few extra square roots and trig functions can completely bog down the processor This kind of feature creep and code bloat has seriously impacted Marlin's performance over time as people ask more and more of the old AVR In comparison a 32bit processor doesn't just have a faster clock and more clock cycles it is also able to do much more complex math in fewer clock cycles because it has dedicated hardware functionality that takes care of many of the steps an 8bit processor must do in software Do 8bit processors work Sure they work surprisingly well for what they are and what we ask of them But they unquestionably limit the performance and features of modern 3D printers Even today's current generation of 32bit processors is already being maxed out by high speed printers and math-heavy features The 8bit processor is already two generations behind what would qualify as a modern 3D printer controller ",

        "answers": " 1 If we're talking about FFF/FDM printers Accuracy of the electronics and motors allows it yes But how FDM printers work it might be very hard to lay down layers of molten plastic so small as to preserve little details in the X and Y axis not much of a problem doing 20 micron layer height though Z resolution Check this answer to find out what the X and Y resolution is and what it depends on https 3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/509/381 You'll need both a small enough nozzle as well as somehow cool the plastic because since the printed objects are so tiny the nozzle keeps contact with the surface surrounding it and heats it longer which might melt the whole object or even char it I've seen very few people do tiny prints with success And the smallest nozzles I know are 250 micron Not trying to dscourage you just letting you know If it was easy to do I think more people would be doing it and more companies would be advertising their printers as capable of such a thing So you'll have around 20 micron Z resolution and around maybe 200 in the X/Y If that's enough for you then you could try Calibrating it all won't be easy tiniest backlash will be noticeable 2 It's a lot easier with curing resin 3d printers SLA or DLP Most of them actually have trouble printing larger objects ironically trouble sticking to the bed and cracking of the 3d print Even here badly calibrated lasers would prevent you from doing this and even many Form 1 users have reported their lasers being assembled poorly resulting in poor beam profile Size of the laser beam profile aka laser spot size is what determines the X/Y resolution for SLA 3d printers With the Form 2 its 140 micron unless you'll get a badly calibrated printer For DLP printers it's easier it's the resolution of the DLP projector divided from the size of the print area  Strictly by looking at the technical specifications of an FDM printer there are a few things to note regarding the maximum print quality you can expect to achieve The minimum layer height here given to be 0.1 mm The nozzle diameter here given to be 0.4 mm Minimum layer height On a finished print the minimum layer height will affect how visible the horisontal lines of the print will be Printing at a lower layer height can dramatically increase the smoothness of the finished part while equally increasing the printing time among several other things A minimum layer height of 0.1 mm is fairly common for low-cost desktop FDM printers Nozzle diameter Just like the layer height defines the vertical resolution of a print the nozzle diameter defines the sharpness of horizontal features of a print When printing with a large nozzle diameter all sharp edges and corners of the model will have a slight roundness to them the larger the nozzle diameter the more rounded sharp corners will be and vice versa You might think of it as making a detailed drawing with a blunt pencil A nozzle diameter of 0.4 mm can perhaps be considered the standard for desktop FDM printers today and will allow you to print fairly accurate parts Will the daVinci work for you Since I've never worked with the daVinci printer before I cannot make a statement on it's user friendliness or actual performance In general if you intend to use it to print fragile complex models such as insects I believe a resin based printer might be more right for you since they typically will allow for much higher reproduction of details than FDM printers Printing solid/compact structures like coins and nuts on the other hand can typically be handled by a well calibrated FDM printer ",

        "answers": " I got with no prior experience a 5th generation model soon after its release and indeed had painful troubles with the extruder and had it replaced under warranty Firmware from late 2014 on has produced much better results It still needs far more work than say a laser printer but that might be simply part of the technology Overall thus my answer is yes I also just noted this week that Makerbot is about to rebase an improved Extruder that claims to further reduce clogging problems  Makerbot claims the problems are fixed I have heard from a number of resellers that the problems are fixed Unfortunately both of those are somewhat biased sources It's surprisingly hard to get good info on the subject very few credible people are talking about recent experiences with the product line Issue 1 The main surviving user forum https groups.google.com/forum forum/makerbot-users has had the torrent of people reporting 5th gen issues more or less dry up There ARE still people posting issues but at a fairly low level that is not far outside what you would expect for an average hobbyist printer What we DON'T know is whether the flood of complaints has slowed because they're working better or because very few people are actually buying them any more Issue 2 The power-users and community leaders that typically evaluate and review 3d printers are all avoiding the 5th gen line like the plague Makerbot burned up a lot of community good-will by going closed source with the Replicator 2 and lost more good-will through a series of misunderstandings over patent applications and the Thingiverse terms of service Takerbot scandals and put the nail in the coffin by knowingly releasing a non-functional 5th gen product line Very few credible people are willing to give them a chance at this point so there is a severe shortage of unbiased reviews Issue 3 Makerbot has a proven history of buying off journalists and reviewers to get positive 5th gen press Some verifiable examples Hundreds of fake 5-star Amazon reviews from paid review accounts A relevant analysis http www.amazon.com/review/R2JI8LRRXZYNX1 Not verified but related a widely-believed rumor states that the German Amazon site actually wiped all of Makerbot's 5th Gen reviews because of blatant tampering http www.amazon.de/MakerBot-MP05825-Replicator-5th-H%C3%B6he/dp/B0183TP806 The CES awards initially given to the 5th Gen line were given before Makerbot had functional firmware None of the 5th Gens at the CES launch were functional All demo prints shown were made on Replicator 2s How could a non-functional product win awards Not hard to figure that one out Historical positive press in the 3DP journalism media 3ders Make Magazine etc has been directly proportional to the volume of ad-buys from Makerbot or the parent company Stratasys I could keep going but you get the idea So it's hard to evaluate the reality of the situation But even IF the Smart Extruder issues are truly all fixed jams leveling issues thermocouple connection filament encoder failures etc there are still meaningful problems with the product line The print quality is not impressive The motion mechanics which have not been appreciably changed to my knowledge are not great The Smart Extruder is basically a giant pendulum wobbling off the side of a non-optimal gantry selection of an H-bot architecture Makerbot has addressed the floppy construction via firmware tweaks to significantly slow down the machine to give marginally-acceptable print quality According to most reports I have seen a Replicator 5th Gen will print significantly slower than a Replicator 2 for example Expect in the neighborhood of perhaps 30-40 longer print times than comparable printers The price tag is roughly double or even triple the current market price for the size and print quality output of the machine There are so many great printers on the market now for significantly less money that it's kind of nuts to drop the cash on a Makerbot It is marketed as a PLA-only machine That's fine if you're printing art and trinkets but it's not a great option for mechanical parts While you CAN print other materials this is not technically supported The support plan structure has quite frankly become abusive Makerbot used to have really helpful phone tech support but the crushingly massive volume of 5th gen troubleshooting requests forced them into a paid tech support model Around the same time Makerbot shut down their user community forum and deleted links to external technical resources off their website So unless you know the right places to go support is scarce For official tech support you must buy Makercare or pay for each help ticket This is completely out of line with industry norms for a hobbyist/consumer 3d printer They essentially took their biggest liability unreliable printers and tried to twist it into a profit center I personally think this is a significant reason to avoid the company entirely Is it possible to get good results from a Replicator 5th Gen Sure But it's a poor value for the cost from a company that has spent the last few years systematically driving away its former loyal user base I would recommend staying away until there's some significant change in the product line at minimum  I do not think the 5 th generation is a reliable product I think you are best going with the older Rep 2 that printer is by far the best Makerbot jumped the ship and released the 5 th generation before it was ready due to pressure from the board Love the Rep 2 by far the best printer out there This is because if the extruder gets clogged you can easily fix it With the 5 th generation you will either have to send in the extruder for repairs or buy a new one completely  TL;DR Save your money and look elsewhere We purchased two Replicator 5 th generation for use on two different campuses They were purchased at the same time One of the units was defective out of the box and was sent back and replaced Then the extruders became clogged again and again on both campuses through lighter than average use I would say We bought two new extruders after we got as much use as possible out of the originals Then of course they became useless Tech support recommended purchasing the Smart Extruder at a premium price with a promise that this would solve all of our problems They did for a short while I must point out that these printers were not under heavy use situations Now we have suffered a catastrophic failure with one of the printers Possibly a power supply issue or main board Time will tell ",

        "answers": " The four main motor speed limits in a 3d printer are Firmware step generation frequency limits Firmware motion planner effects Loss of torque and precision due to motor coil inductance and back-EMF effects Mid-band resonance Step generation rate limits will depend on the firmware and controller board used There is a significant range particularly when 32bit firmwares and RTOS-based platforms like MachineKit are compared to 8bit firmwares running on Atmega AVRs Some examples Marlin on a 16 MHz 8bit Atmega can only run the stepper interrupt at 10,000 hz without bogging down the processor and blocking other critical algorithms like motion planning It can fire step rates up to 40,000 hz by pulsing the step line two or four times per interrupt which effectively drops the microstep level in software and runs the motors rougher/louder Repetier on the same Atmega can run the stepper interrupt at 12,000 hz because it is optimized more for execution speed than Marlin Repetier on an 84 MHz 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 can run the stepper interrupt at 80,000 Hz These limits typically only affect actual stepper speed when relatively fine microstepping is used Consider an example based on a very typical Marlin printer configuration Microstepping of at least 1/4 is strongly recommended to avoid resonance issues so let's start with 1/16 stepping This allows quad-stepping to effectively output 1/4-steps Starting with finer microstepping will drop our top speed and coarser microstepping will be louder and may encounter resonance so this is a good starting point Then asssume a typical 32mm-per-rev pulley on a 1.8 degree 200 steps/rev stepper motor This system has a resolution of 200*16/32 100 steps/mm At 40,000 Hz total stepping rate quad-stepping at 10,000 Hz we can theoretically travel at 400 mm/s before hitting Marlin's hard cap That's probably going to be a higher RPM than we want to run the motor anyway so it's not a very impactful limit In comparison if we started at 1/128 stepping such as with the THB6128 driver chip our top speed with 8bit Marlin would be 50 mm/s That's quite slow Firmware motion planners can further limits motor speed by ramping up and down to traverse turns and corners If the model geometry has lots of sharp turns the target speeds commanded by the gcode are likely to never actually be reached Only long straight line paths will have enough ramping time to hit the speed target You can see this yourself by printing a very small model at a variety of feedrates and timing the actual print duration at a certain point increases in the commanded speed will make no difference on actual print times Another constraint some firmwares enforce is requiring the ability to safely decelerate to a stop within the length of all the motion commands in the planner queue This allows the printer to gracefully handle a sudden loss of input such as as if the host computer stops transmitting USB commands or if the SD card experiences a series of read errors If the printer just abruptly stops from full speed when it runs out of commands it is likely to lose position and ruin the print Whereas if it can decelerate to a safe stopping speed it may be able to resume after the command stream resumes In terms of actual motor behavior the inductance and back-EMF introduce significant limits because they decrease motor torque at higher RPMs This produces a torque/RPM curve that drops off at higher speeds http www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html Note in the picture that there is a flat constant current region on the left side at low speeds This is the range where the chopping driver is limiting coil current On the right side of the curve current is not able to reach the target before it must be switched back off for the next step That reduces field strength and thus torque There are two separate effects to consider here Motor coils are inductors which means there is a first-order lag between applied voltage and coil current A standard bipolar stepper motor with a microstepping driver must raise the coil current from zero to max or from max to zero every full step eg every sixteen 1/16th microsteps At high step rates there is not enough time to fully charge the coil to its max current before the next step requires dropping the current back down Without developing full coil current on each step torque is lost Every motor is also a generator and spinning the rotor generates back-EMF voltage within the motor coils That voltage waveform gets overlaid on top of the drive voltage waveform with a phase shift dependent on the rotor position relative to the coil energization position In simple terms this voltage attempts to brake the motor it always does whatever will slow the motor down This means it opposes the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying forward torque or assists the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying brake torque For a practical discussion of speed limits we can simplify the situation by assuming back-EMF voltage opposes the drive voltage applied to the coils This means there is less effective voltage raising/lowering coil current and it takes longer for the current to change and less coil current is developed than would be the case without back-emf This further depresses the torque/RPM curve of the motor And when the back-EMF voltage is around the same magnitude as the drive voltage significant motor instability can result because of complex feedback effects between rotor position and effective coil voltage You can play with these effects using different motor configurations and speeds for a few popular 3D printer stepper drivers using my stepper driver simulator https github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim In closed-loop applications with position feedback and high-end drivers that can damp various instability modes it may be ok to run the stepper all the way down the torque curve at very high RPMs In more typical open-loop 3D printer applications it's generally best to stick to the low-RPM part of the torque curve before inductance and back-EMF really take over the motor behavior Losing too much torque can easily mean skipping steps and losing position ruining the print Another important effect for steppers is mid-band resonance This is not a normal mechanical resonance but actually an electromechanical resonance effect It's quite complicated but the short explanation is that a stepper has an intrinsic 90-degree phase shift between position and torque and when speeds rise to a point where coil inductance introduces an additional 90-degree phase shift between coil current and applied voltage the electromechanical system has a highly-unstable 180-degree phase lag and thus creates a negative feedback loop This can rapidly drop motor torque until the motor loses synchronicity with the driver's applied voltage and stalls Mid-band resonance only occurs when coil current is limited by inductance It cannot occur in the constant-current drive range because there is not enough phase lag between applied voltage and coil current http www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html Unfortunately measured torque curves available from manufacturers almost never show resonance zones because the curves are produced by loading motors with friction-brakes that damp any kind of resonance effect from building Whereas a 3D printer drivetrain load is almost entirely inertial accelerating a mass which is much more prone to resonance High-end drivers can automatically detect and damp mid-band resonance but typical low-cost 3D printer drivers do not have this capability It is generally prudent to avoid entering an RPM range where mid-band resonance may occur This is easily accomplished by sticking to the left side of the torque curve in the constant-current operating region This ensures high torque and good stability For a concrete example consider the popular Kysan 1124090 stepper with a 24v power supply https ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor To maintain high torque and avoid mid-band resonance we would want to keep the RPM to about 400 or less For the same 32mm-per-rev pulley mentioned above that would limit speeds to around 200-240 mm/s Higher speeds are possible but may encounter reliability issues This speed of course assumes a 24v PSU is used to match the measured torque curve a 12v PSU would have a significantly lower top speed before inductance starts to limit coil current around half as fast Higher supply voltage greatly increases the top effective speed for the motor Again you can easily simulate this effect using https github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim This simulator output chart shows how inductance and back-EMF are keeping coil current from reaching the target For practical drivetrain design a motor/driver simulator is really the best tool in the toolbox for finding the point where performance will start to degrade due to inability to hit current targets It's simply too complex to apply simple equations or rules of thumb with any accuracy These electrical effects and the firmware step generation limits are likely to be the two main restrictions on motor speed for most printers Of course how fast you can melt plastic will tend to limit printing speeds significantly below the true motor speed limits but that's a different discussion For the moment we can simply say that top motor speed tends to be unimportant for print moves in typical Cartesian printers However there are a few instances where they are likely to drive printer performance Linear Deltas where carriages may need to run several times faster than the effector for certain move directions Geared extruders with high reduction ratio eg much over 5:1 for high retraction speeds Short-pitch lead screws or all-thread that need high rotation speeds to achieve moderate linear speeds ",

angle inverted motor delta[Z_AXIS cartesian[Z_AXIS This function takes care of the delta geometry and calculations needed to convert the x,y,z coordinates of the segment endpoints to corresponding positions for the carriages The translated coordinates are then passed to plan_buffer_line which calculates the steps needed for each stepper motor and actually makes these steps happen The exact kinematics used in this function are explained in much more detail at the Marlin github What is important to note is that plan_buffer_line moves the carriages linearly and the printhead thus describes an arc and not a straight line A straight line move is thus approximated by many small arcs  There are two main special steps to the technique used by most open-source 3d printer controllers Divide each linear gcode segment into lots of very small subsegments Segmentation Use some basic trigonometry or the pythagorean theorem to tie extruder position to carriage height for each of the three towers Inverse Kinematics to find the target position for each small segment The inverse kinematics are surprisingly simple A virtual 90 degree triangle is constructed from two known lengths to solve for the unknown third length The fixed delta arm length is the hypotenuse of the triangle The horizontal distance between the column joints and end-effector joints is calculated from the XY coordinates of the nozzle and the fixed position of the column to determine the length of the lower side of the triangle The length of the upper side of the triangle is calculated from the previous two via the pythagorean theorem The length of the upper side is added to the nozzle Z height to get the necessary carriage height I think the best open-source reference here is Steve Grave's Rostock Kinematics document rev3 available for download here https groups.google.com/d/msg/deltabot/V6ATBdT43eU/jEORG_l3dTEJ Some relevant pictures These inverse kinematics calculations are performed for each carriage to get a carriage space target position and this is performed for every path sub-segment The results from these steps can then be reinserted back into the standard linear path interpolation techniques for the printer in which it fires steps in the necessary ratios and at the necessary rates to produce the desired straight-line motion and acceleration/velocity profile How THAT is done is a different question The net effect is that the printer will move through a series of small linear carriage movements linear meaning constant speed with respect to time that collectively approximate the necessary curved quadratic position with respect to time carriage motions required to produce a straight-line end-effector move Constant speed before acceleration slowdowns are applied in order to obey dynamics constraints anyway Again that's the subject of a different question Segmentation is very similar to the process of using a polygon to approximate a circle If the facets are small enough the polygon is a good approximation Higher Segmentation rates produce less path-following error The primary conceptual difference between drawing circle arcs and Delta motion paths is that the so-called faceted arc with Delta Segmentation is constructed in height-vs-time coordinates instead of the X-vs-Y coordinates you'd use to draw a circle on a computer screen This system is used in large part because support for Delta style printers was originally bolted onto GRBL-based motion planners which were written exclusively for straight-line motion paths in Cartesian printers It was a relatively minimal modification to the existing codebase compared to implementing full quadratic path interpolation Techniques have evolved over the years And alternate approaches are often used for example the dc42 fork of RepRapFirmware performs exact path-following without segmentation by recalculating the proper time for the next step after every step This is functionally equivalent to approximating a circle with a polygon facet count so high that every pixel on the screen gets its own facet So it is exactly as accurate as the positioning resolution of the motors allows The downside is that this segmentation-free technique is fairly processor-intensive so it only works on relatively fast controllers not the older 8bit Atmega AVR that powers most existing consumer/hobbyist printers today Other techniques are possible The academic parallel robotics control literature is a whole other world of mathematical techniques and complexity in order to produce generalized control algorithms that work for a wide range of robot mechanisms The version we use in open-source 3d printers is quite simple and application-specific in comparison ",

        "answers": " If I understand your question correctly it sounds like you're looking somewhere within the RepRap realm The RepRap community is mostly responsible for the boom in consumer 3D printing in the past 10 years and that's most likely because it's open source RepRap designs are mostly dynamic and most parts can be 3D printed so you could theoretically build a larger frame for your machine and use a slicing engine that allows you to set the build volume I believe Slic3r allows you to customize the build space I'm not sure though  One big challenge with scaling anything up or down is that not all properties or characteristics scale linearly Consider a trivial case a small cube If you double the size you've quadrupled the surface area and octupled the weight If you take a desktop-sized 3d printer design and just double the size it will weigh 8 times as much But all the bolts holding it together are only 4 times as strong So weight-bearing bolts are effectively under twice the strain per unit of cross-sectional area the exact factor depends of lots of things orientation leverage etc If you scale up by 10x they'll potentially be under 10 times greater stress and probably snap Many many parts will have similar issues Drive belts that are twice as wide and twice as thick will still have 1/2 the relative strength and stiffness for the motors to overcome The stepper motors have to move 8 times the weight and you'll want them to move far far faster But steppers lose torque when you spin them faster My main printer is pretty much a MendelMax 2 but the Y axis is about 6 times bigger X and Z are normal On MM2 the whole build platform moves along Y on my printer it weighs far more than on a regular-size MM2 it's 6 times the mass just because of size besides that it has to be much stiffer to avoid sagging over that distance I went to a larger motor but it could still barely move the axis I eventually got it to move at pretty normal speed but to print long objects it really should be 6 times faster or so That would require an amazing motor and really big electronics to drive it Another challenge is the printing material 20mm diameter PLA fiber would be really impressive but a little hard to find and a spool would be hard to lift The power needed to melt it fast enough would be impressive too Bridge and house printers I've seen in reports use pumped concrete through about a 100mm wide nozzle I have no idea what the nozzle is made of to stand up to the abrasion See http www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-09/21/giant-3d-printer-builds-houses for some cool pictures and video Scaling up is a fascinating project but it's harder than it looks  As far as I know right now all the 3D printers that can print houses bridges etc are experimental models and sometimes vey elaborate art projects they just don't exist except as one-off creations designed as a proof-of-concept showing this can be done Maybe some of those project published their plans and code but they are not designed for mass production or general use even if you manage to build another copy of one of them it will probably be able to print just the same project the original printed You specifically asked about speed material and build area Speed the speed really depends on the size of the printer's nozzle the typical desktop printer has a 0.4mm nozzle if you replace it with a 1mm nozzle the printer will be approximately twice as fast 1.25 nozzle area vs 3.14 nozzle area assuming you have an hotend designed for larger nozzles that can melt the plastic fast enough Now the house printer does not use a standard desktop hotend see material below and buildings don't have fine details so you can make the head much larger However as far as I know the early prototypes are still much slower then conventional construction methods Material houses are typically not made of plastic the printers I know of have welding equipment instead of an hotend and extrude steel There are probably other methods but I bet all of them use typical construction materials such as steel and not thermoplastic Size and last but not least it's obviously not practical to build a printer with as house sized platform the house printers are actually relatively small robots that travel across the construction project leaving material behind them and then climb over the previous layer to print the next part ",

        "answers": " An 8bit Atmega can provide bare-bones delta performance with Marlin eg 40mm/s print speed or pretty good performance with Repetier due to more optimized algorithms For a small and simple delta like a bare-bones Mini Kossel 8bit may be fine If you want to do high-speed printing or use any of the fancier features you should go with 32bit The big issue with 8bit comes up when you want to do something that taxes the MCU Delta kinematics already add a lot of extra math on top of all the normal printer functions like command parsing motion planning and heater control For example adding any of these to an 8bit Delta can cause issues Bed tilt compensation auto-leveling the coordinate space rotation transform adds a lot of extra floating point calculations to every movement segment That really taxes the 8bit Atmega since it does not have native floating point support Note that pre-print auto-calibration such as in the RichCattell Marlin fork is not the same as bed tilt compensation and does not add any run-time processor load Full graphics LCDs refreshing the LCD screen for animations and status reports takes a surprising amount of horsepower 8bit Marlin is widely known to suffer from stuttering and print quality issues when running a GLCD on a delta Highly faceted smooth curves particularly over USB the high rate of gcode command processing sucks up a lot of clock cycles particularly in firmwares that run USB comms as a top-priority interrupt What the Due or other 32bit board option does for you is de-bottleneck the MCU so you can push the printer harder or utilize features that add processor load Here's why they're so much better In simple clock speed terms the SAM3X8E in the Due/Duet/Alligator/etc is about 5 times faster than the Atmega 2560 and the LPC1769 in the Smoothieboard/MKS-SBASE/etc is about 7 times faster But they're actually MUCH higher performance than clock speed alone would suggest because the 32bit architecture and native floating point support mean far fewer clock cycles are required for complex calculations They also have more RAM meaning the the firmware can manage more features and look farther ahead when motion planning They also have more program space meaning the firmware can if desired be compiled as a single full-featured build that covers all possible printers as RepRapFirmware and Smoothieware do and thus end-users don't have to edit and compile code in the Arduino IDE to configure the firmware The Atmega line requires hundreds of conditional compile statements in the firmware to exclude unused features from the binary to get the memory footprint down All that said the switch from an 8bit Atmega AVR to a 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 is still just an upgrade from a late-1990s processor to an early-2000s processor Neither is modern by any stretch For example the BeagleBone Black used by Redeem and MachineKit utterly blows away the Due in processing power and memory But those options have steep learning curves at the moment The Due can still be bogged down by printing very fast with lots of features enabled It's a big upgrade on an Atmega but I predict it's going to be replaced by much faster controllers within the next few years Announcements of upcoming next-gen controller boards are already trickling out To summarize the answer is yes a Due-type board is a good buy if you want a high-performance printer It will meet 99 of user's needs today But it will be replaced in a few years just like the Atmegas are being replaced now As for specific Due shields I strongly recommend NOT going with RAMPS-FD It was cloned for sale by Asian companies before the design was finished which seemingly caused the original designer to abandon it before working out all the bugs RAMPS-FDv1 has some nasty design flaws such as heaters turning on while flashing firmware RAMPS-FDv2 is better but can experience unreliable and oddball behavior due to unresolved issues in the circuits intended to make it compatible with both 3v3 boards like the Due and 5v boards like the Mega For example the thermistor voltage reference circuit needs modifying to work right and there appears to be timing issues in the 3v3-5v level shifters RADDS is a good Due shield It is a simpler more reliable more compact version of RAMPS-FD It is very popular in Germany and has recently late 2015 become available for sale in the US I also recommend purchasing the Due R3-E instead of the regular Due R3 Anecdotally the E version appears to eliminate some firmware bootup issues that can occur when the board is first powered at lower than nominal voltage One possible downside to the Due is that Arduino just announced they are no longer manufacturing it So all new Due boards from here on will be made by 3rd parties That's not necessarily bad since it's open source and many other companies will surely continue making them but there won't be any more made by Arduino For single-board options using the same SAM3X8E processor as the Due the Duet 0.8.5 is becoming quite popular It runs RepRapFirmware which has some great Delta features The Alligator runs Repetier There are several other beta/experimental/development boards in the works too The community appears to be moving towards the Due and Due-compatible boards over the other various options ",

        "answers": " There's an answer here that holds some of the same concepts Regarding your questions Does lowering the temperature help Raising it Yes lowering the temperature can help I've found that it is best to stay closer to the lower end of the material's melting point and just a bit above the point Not only does this help with potential over extrusion but also shortens the time it takes for the material to cool refer to the link above However this could cause clogging if your temperature is too low Keep an eye on your drive gear to see if there is too much friction while at lower temperatures Increasing may keep the drive gear from eating your filament Does speeding up or slowing down the print head help I prefer to print slower most of the time to allow the material to cool a bit more to avoid curling/warping I primarily print with ABS so it matters more You might be able to give and take between temperature and speed Consider if your nozzle is cooler and your speed is up bridging gaps might yield the same results as if you proportionately swap these two values This concept may only matter if you are in a pinch to get the part done Again I prefer slowing my machine down as it allows current/previous layers to cool more before continuing This can be especially helpful with overhangs when paired with lowering your nozzle temperature Does increasing/decreasing the extrusion diameter or layer height help I assume that extrusion diameter equals layer height not difference in nozzle diameter aka swapping nozzles I'm not completely sure but I think this depends on the part as well as slicing engine settings For me MakerWare is pretty good about proportionately adjusting extrusion steps with layer height so I see an equal change in the width of the extrusion I would think that in general a larger layer height would yield a larger extrusion width This would be helpful when printing overhangs but may not be helpful when printing bridges a larger strand will retain heat longer than a smaller one Hopefully this helps please comment if you need more information/clarification  The two most important things you can do are Provide adequate cooling to solidify the plastic quickly Minimize layer height Cooling is really obvious You need the plastic to solidify before it has a chance to sag PLA in particular has to shed a lot of heat before it is fully solid A fan and air guide setup using a squirrel-cage radial blower around the nozzle is optimal A little 30mm or 40mm axial fan will not provide optimal performance Low layer height when slicing is less obvious but is extremely effective When you use thinner layers two things happen There is less melted plastic per pass and a higher surface area to volume ratio so the fresh material cools faster A larger percentage of each strand in the overhang is supported by the previous strand If you do 0.2mm thick by 0.4mm wide half of each strand is unsupported But if you do 0.1mm thick by 0.4mm wide only a quarter of each strand is unsupported When you combine these two effects it is possible to exceed 70 degree overhangs with good surface quality Another lesser factor is printing shells/perimeters inside-out rather than outside-in This helps anchor the outermost strand a little better as the overhang is built This is pretty minor though ",

        "answers": " Considering that you wish to print the clip in the vertical orientation but without supports I would suggest that you create a suitable taper of the clip from the bottom The taper would provide necessary support-free support but may reduce the amount of bottle access one has to remove it from the clips As such you could also reduce the amount of the straight vertical segment of the clip at the front which would allow the support-free support to start at a higher level from the bottom If the bottle bottom encirclement is raised you'd receive additional retention You could then reduce more the upper encirclement and taper for easier release I too prefer to design models that require no support but have run into the same circumstance where the weaker axis takes a disproportionate load  Printing the model vertically should certainly be considered as that will alleviate your issue by a whole lot If altering the design by adding a taper to your model isn't what you are looking for placing a manual removable support structure at the outer edge og the overhang could also be an option This way you could print the overhang as a bridge making it much easier to print vertically Also have you considered using another material than ABS There are a large variety of filament types available that have better semi-flexible properties than ABS without sacrificing overall strength For instance PETG and Taulman's Alloy 910 filaments are both very strong and surprisingly flexible  The Short Just print vertically Reduce the clip size to bring them closer to the centerline Try a vapor treatment or epoxy to increase strength The Long Ultimately printing the object vertically so the clips are printed horizontally would be the strongest solution Alternatively you could adjust your model to bring down the size of the clips to reduce the strain Consider making more of a cup or cone on the bottom for the vial to slide into center Then reduce the length of the clips to bring the closer to where the center of the vial will be Make sure however that your clips still curve slightly around the center and maybe a mm or two beyond From a design point the bottom clip is probably unnecessary Another option might also be to use a small vapor treatment on the ABS Depending on how deep the alcohol penetrates it could diminish some of the issues with the part cracking along the grain This is just a fairly labor intensive process compared to some of the others posted here Side note those are great looking prints I like how smooth ABS can look Its hard to tell but it looks like your part has a bit of warping on the bottom Definitely look into some of the warping questions here on Stack  I agree with the previous assessments printing vertically for that part of the clip will definitely alleviate the layer adhesion being your weak point You might also consider splitting that clip as a separate modular piece which will clip/socket/bolt into the stand Depending on implementation this would give you the ability to Print that part vertically without supports Swap the part if it breaks without having to print the whole assembly again Preattach the clip to vials which may be good or bad depending on your usage  It looks like those clips are thin and need to bend pretty far to let the vial out Try to make the clips thicker but with a smaller clip to retain the vial so that it doesn't have to bend as much This is what I'm thinking in beautiful MS-PAINT form  If you don't want your clip to break you'll have to engineer in some form of flexibility in a strong part of your design For example right now it looks like the bases of the clips are sitting rather solidly on the underlying surface such that it can't move I'd suggest that instead it might be better to have two clips attach separately to the bottom using a post and have each post attached to the solid part of the base with a piece of plastic whose horizontal cross-section is a somewhat-rounded accordion-style double zig-zag From the top Having multiple pleats will mean that each degree that the clips flex outward will only require each pleat to flex a fraction of a degree You'd have to play around to find out what number of pleats would give a suitable degree of stiffness and flexibility but if the printer renders the design by drawing the zig zags stresses should be concentrated in the directions where the material is strongest  Come on Wider clips will just survive a bit longer The real cause is the orientation plane of printing Continues filament layer will always be more durable than few layers sticked together So the question is why not to change printing plane You can use better design which utilizes support without using support material ",
        "comments": "Thanks Probably I will print it vertically in the end The reason not to is that it will be an array of these stacked on top of each other so when it's finished it will be quite tall and the bottom part will become an overhang But maybe I'll just print each layer separately and stack them I'm limited to materials available for the Zortrax M200 and the eventual design needs to be white so I think ABS is the only option.@Nathaniel thank you for elaborating +1 I tried suggesting this in my answer but my MS-PAINT skills are lacking.Man I was going to suggest this finished my MS Paint example only to scroll down and see yours Thanks this is a really good idea If I don't change the printing orientation then having the clips sides be vertical also means each pair of layers has more surface area in contact with each other so it should be stronger.Thanks this is all useful It doesn't look warped in real life I think that's an issue with the camera's optics.No problem glad to see my other suggestions for clip design http 3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/736/tips-for-making-parts-that-push-snap-together helped too.This works perfectly and makes a nice satisfying click when the vial is inserted Thanks to all the other answers too they were all very useful.Try printing the original design vertically This is about print layers which tend to segregate.Printing the clip as a separate module also saves a ton of printing time and material required.Nice T-slots ",

        "answers": " The main requirement here is temperature resistance A 3D printer extruder is very very hot and will easily exceed the ratings of many typical silicone glues in normal service or during a runaway event You should always plan for an eventual thermal runaway They're alarmingly common with cheap kit printers Even high-temp glues will not survive the temperatures an extruder can reach at full power if the firmware locks up Muffler putty is popular for fixing thermistors because it's one of the few widely-available ways of attaching a thermistor that will easily withstand the heat In fact it will survive after the aluminum hot block melts Yes that can happen But muffler putty is fairly brittle and has a different coefficient of thermal expansion from aluminum so there is some risk of the thermistor detaching over time I really don't recommend puttying thermistors used in extruders many people do but it's less robust and less secure for long-term use than the proper hardware fixing methods found in modern hot block designs like the E3Dv6 The temperature sensing is sufficiently fast and accurate simply by putting the thermistor into a pocket in the hot block without any kind of potting around the glass bead High-temp RTV glues are very suitable for heated build plates Pretty much any RTV such as from your local automotive repair store is fine if you just want to attach a thermistor to a plate However silicone heaters will require silicone adhesives I've had good success with Dow Corning 736 ",

        "answers": " Taken in order your questions Maintenance for a resin printer means keeping the vat or tray clean using appropriate methods to remove the unused resin or leaving it in the vat per manufacturer's directions Cleaning the tray should be done also per manufacturer's spec although each printer's user forum may provide better or more effective options The Pegasus Touch has a caution regarding dripping resin on the mirrors so there's operational care considerations for these types of printers There is a build platform for these printers The flatness and level are as critical or more so for resin printers as the resolution can be astonishingly high If any portion of a print does not bond to the platform that entire print will have a failed section creating an entirely failed print Gravity is not particularly helpful in that respect at least with the Pegasus Touch The release medium varies from device to device The Pegasus Touch originally used PDMS silicon release compound and now uses what's called a SuperVat The plastic material in the SuperVat is purported to provide better release and fewer failures along with increased lifespan PDMS becomes cloudy from repeated printing in the same location and can be torn away from the vat if the print does not properly release I've become aware of a product from Australia that has had good reports from use in a B9 Creator resin printer The report indicates that it releases the model quite easily and barely turns cloudy I have an order pending for this material as I am hopeful it will perform as described The mechanics are also varied One expects a system to raise and lower the build platform and to direct the laser or illumination system DLP but generally this type of printer is somewhat simpler mechanically Because I live in a hot humid climate my Pegasus Touch remains in the box and my brain is about to explode with what I've learned of using it Environmental conditions are likely to vary with different machines I've seen references that 70 degrees F is too cold others that say 70-75 degrees F is just fine anything higher is too hot Another user says that 65 degrees is good The type of resin also becomes an important factor for environmental conditions The laser will create heat in the resin so I'm inclined to believe that cooler is better Different colors require different durations of laser light somewhat akin to various plastics having different temperatures supports and overhangs are important considerations in an SLA or DLP printer just as they are in FDM Expect also that many of the resin printers require that the user purchase only the product provided by the manufacturer This isn't necessarily a negative as most of the resin sources are priced similarly If I've missed any part of your question let me know  Despite how many vendors make it appear resin-curing SLA/DLP printers are industrial or commercial tools that are really not suitable for home desktop use Here are the major downsides Significantly more expensive to operate than FDM printers in most cases The resin is seriously toxic until fully cured Fumes can be an issue for users handling raw resin and you should NEVER put a photopolymer print into a chemically-sensitive environment like an aquarium or children's toy Prints require messy post-processing to rinse off excess resin usually with rubbing alcohol and additional UV light exposure to finish hardening the photopolymer The used alcohol/resin rinse mix is basically hazmat waste In bottom-up printers the window in the print vat is typically a consumable Some printers require replacing the vat after every liter or two of cured resin Technology is advancing rapidly here though The peel mechanism in bottom-up printers is often a major source of print flaws due to the need to rock/tilt/slide the print to free it from the vat window In top-down printers you have to pay a large up-front consumables cost to initially fill the resin tank There are workarounds here like floating a layer of resin on brine but these have their own technical issues If you leave the resin in the printer for an extended period you'll probably find a hardened layer on the surface from stray light exposure and have to clean out or replace the vat Resin vats/tanks need to be kept clean and free of cured resin debris from failed prints or stray light Every combination of resin chemistry printer light source and printer optics requires specific tuning to dial in the photopolymer curing behavior This means it's somewhat difficult to change resin brands and you may effectively be locked into the printer manufacturer's resin Many light sources will change in intensity or develop dim regions over time as they age which will either harm print quality require period recalibration or require frequent light source replacement There is a limited number of options for print materials Technology here is advancing rapidly but for the most part SLA/DLP prints are non-load-bearing models with a limited range of color options These are some pretty significant user experience downsides compared to a consumer desktop FDM printer It's more hazard more work and more cost than FDM SLA/DLP is primarily advantageous where high resolution or high print speeds are required ",

        "comments": "Definitely not big enough gauge for a heated bed Actually it's probably not big enough for steppers and a 12v extruder either.@RyanCarlyle That seems to contradict your own statement that it's good for 7A 7A is more than enough enough to power an extruder and steppers https youtu.be/5uUb-VnTzlU?t=11m31s though if you have very beefy steppers and drivers to match you might run into trouble.I think you mean in the event of an overload In the event of a dead short the protection should kick in almost immediately well before the wires have any chance of heating up.It's not uncommon for PSUs to allow significantly higher draw than their rating before the overcurrent protection kicks in For a high-current low-voltage PSU like this the supply wires terminals board traces etc can provide enough short circuit resistance a few tenths of ohms that a dead short won't actually trip the overcurrent protection fast enough to avoid immolating undersized components.A 40w 12v extruder draws 3.3A alone that's half your absolute max wire capacity Then each stepper is likely to be between 0.3A and 2A depending on stepper specs driver selection current setting etc PSU load is max 1.41x higher than the current setting at half step positions with both coils energized Call it 1A each w four steppers 4A Now you're over the wire rating before considering the controller board and fans You MIGHT be ok if you preheat with motors de-energized and have good motor selection so the chopping drivers run efficiently and reduce motor draw from the PSU.And don't forget 7A is chassis wiring rating which means the wire is allowed to heat up considerably Conservative rating should be a fair bit less than that.Yet another reason why we should all be switching to 24v PSUs way safer than 12v PSUs Less risk of wire heating smaller wires for less wire fatigue on moving parts and much more reliable tripping of over-current protection.The 40W extruder example is a bit contrived since PWM will keep the average power draw much lower than the maximum and during heat up steppers would generally not be enabled The video shows that 3A can be enough to run a printer just fine I agree 22AWG is on the thin side and edited my answer to reflect that If you want to get completely technically within the specs you have to account for the fact that the connectors on RAMPS aren't even rated for 30A so no matter how thick you make the wires you'll always have that point of failure before the PSU enters protection mode.Not contrived at all many/most people home while preheating and there's the mid-print cold-pause and resume case too Max heater power for 1min with steppers engaged is an expected load case In a NORMAL operations yes PWM drops the average current draw for both steppers and heaters But we don't know what kind of crappy off-spec parts are being used here Maybe they're 12v rated motors that will run the drivers at 100 duty cycle instead of proper low-inductance motors that will only need 30 duty cycle That alone is likely to max out 22awg wiring.And good point on the connectors We need to be very careful to only give very conservative advice when it comes to newbies playing with electronics that can burn their house down That means factoring in worst-case load combos and all the weak links everywhere in the circuit.@RyanCarlyle When you say 22ga above do you mean 22awg Is ga shorthand for awg?@RyanCarlyle I ended up using AWG 10 wire type MTW OR THWN OR THHN it's a pretty thick wire for the wires between the switching power supply and RAMPS 1.4 It's good up to 600V it's overkill but I think it'll do the trick.",

        "answers": " Yes you can increase retraction past E3D's max 2mm recommendation to compensate for Bowden tube stretch and slop The reason for the recommendation is that jams will occur with most all-metal hot ends if you pull molten filament up into the cold zone Any molten filament that enters the cold zone rapidly cools and hardens and sticks to the walls very often forming a jam So the requirement is to keep your retraction distance at the extruder less than 2mm Additional retraction travel that is absorbed by the Bowden tube and not seen at the extruder is fine I personally run 2.5mm retraction on an E3Dv6 Bowden system without any issues  As pointed out by this article you can try to Increase your speed for travel moves Increase retraction length Place objects strategically during print 1 Calibrating travel speed When calibrating travel speed you can work with Maximum travel speed Acceleration Jerk Z-hop/lift I found this acceleration calculator by RepRap Central and video by Thomas Sanladerer very useful when moving at high speed your stepper motors are more susceptible to getting de-tracked by nozzle collision from imperfections during print If this becomes an issue consider increasing your z-lift setting 2 Adjusting retraction You can be fairly certain that your filament will clog if it actually retracts past those 2mm recommended by E3D at the hot end However as pointed out about by Ryan bowden retraction is based on hysteresis meaning that that the actual retraction distance at the hot end is lagging behind the distance retracted at the cold end I have been battling this exact issue on my 30cm bowden tube E3D V6 setup recently and currently use a fairly conservative 2mm retraction I am still getting occasional clogs while printing PETG 3 Distance between objects From the article linked at the top The faster you\u2019re able to move to the next print position the less time there is for filament to ooze from the hot end As such the distance between the printed objects will change the characteristics of the stringing  In addition to the already excellent answers above I want to mention that maybe a change in hotend temperature lower can also help reducing ooze/stringing That is if not other parameters prevent that ",

        "comments": "I've read of people using smartphone apps that calculate the belt tension by measuring the frequency of the plucked belt If you the TO are completely lost and need any kind of confirmation this might be a way to get it easily.Can you explain how this belt tensioner if that is a correct name for it works?@kamuro it's just a spring that you put on the belt It isn't really a tensioner you still have to pull the belt tight somehow but it helps keep the tension consistent.In the meantime I found the idea by image searching belt tensioner too http www.iheartrobotics.com/2009/11/timing-belt-tensioner.html The search also turned up lots of other interesting tensioning designs used in various other industrial sectors too Sweet inspiration On another note I would assume that the current of the stepsticks also is a less important effect I would take a look at the axis motion friction first Parallelity of rods first if the strength of the effect is varying depending on the position.Well depending on drive train design this effect can also apear because of low wrap angle Which means that timing belt surrounds a pulley not enough.@kamuro as TvdZ said it's not real tensioner it's more like laundry clip but it works fine so why not to give it a try But be careful it cost even 2 as a tensioner but if you buy 10 laundry clips you will get 10 tensioners for half od dollar.I didn't want to diminish the idea of using a belt tensioner at all sorry if it came across like that.@kamuro not at all I would advise AGAINST using that kind of belt tensioner Springs anywhere in your drivetrain add ringing at corners The last thing you want in a precision motion control device is stretchy belts.What kind of printer is it Most Cartesian printers that experience X-axis shift are having problems with fatigued electrical wiring to the X stepper or X endstop.@RyanCarlyle Are you sure about that It seems these spring-type tensioners are used in professional printers Ultimaker comes to mind and even some mass-market 2D printers In any case this problem is likely not about belt tension.@RyanCarlyle don't you think these tensioners are just compensate sudden de/acceleration Belt itself is not stretchy its dimension change during acceleration only then it gets back to normal so counting whole amount of the movement dimension doesn't change a bit Timing belt itself is doing the same by its nature isn't it?Yes I'm sure A spring-tensioner is better than a loose belt which is why some Ultimakers have them particularly since getting even belt tension on a UM gantry is hard but a rigid tensioner adjust and lock is superior to a spring tensioner We use fiberglass-core and aramid-core timing belts in 3D printers for a reason because they're as stiff as possible in tension Spring tensioners makes the belt more stretchy Specifically when you turn a corner at positive velocity jerk>0 any springiness in the drivetrain causes increased overshoot and therefore ringing.Should add here that if the clothes-pin spring tensioner is nearly fully extended it will be fairly stiff because the geometry creates a force multiplier to make the spring apply a lot more tension EG see http physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2015/04/physics-life-hack-number-3-getting-your.html But if the spring tensioner is taking up a lot of slack and is not extended it will add springiness to the belt.I used a spring scale meant for fishing But it's really not critical Just make sure it's not skipping teeth on the pulley and you should be fine.I tensioned the belts of my delta printer equally tight solely based on their note when plucked If you have an ear for music that should be fairly straightfoward.@RyanCarlyle It's Cubicon Not popular brand in West Korean made Supposed to be good But soon after getting it this started happening Part of their troubleshooting suggested checking the belt@kamuro thanks will do if needed Although now it seems not the issue.@TextGeek thanks for the tips@TormodHaugene alright Although now it seems unlikely this is the issue.@Tom van der Zanden Any tips how to know if this is stepper current problem I'll most likely end up opening separate thread for that But it would be good to have more info.Looks like a cartesian XY gantry printer from a quick googling If you can pluck the belt like Tom mentioned and get a low note but still get X axis shifting my next guess would be bad X motor or X endstop wiring.thanks all for the input Lots of useful info and tips to consider.@BasharAbdullah your issue is one of possible signs of current problem 1 Check resistor on your SS right next to black central chip 2 There should be R200 or R100 so R=0.2 or 0.1 3 Read current I value from motor label 4 V I R 8 5 this is max voltage which should be set on SS 6 set it and check if your printer works ok 7 if not reduce it 10 15 and chceck if this helps you can repeat 7.@darthpixel thanks I'm new to 3D printing really so will try to tinker and see where I get ",

        "answers": " I don't believe that slicing engines create any sort of solid model that would be useful for CAD simulation When a slicing engine slices a 3D model it's goal is to spit out the preferred machine paths in G-Code of some kind However I've read a few articles done some tests and heard through the grape vine that anywhere between 10 35 is good enough for most applications I once watched a webinar for understanding the new MakerWare interface that explained how they chose such settings Although I can't find the clip directly here is the page for all of MakerBot's webinars I think this webinar was the one I watched explaining a little bit about preferred infill percentages From experience anything over 35 doesn't yield much more strength from infill side of things Beyond 35 and you're going to want to reconsider how you're orienting the print when you print it and what you're printing to utilize the grain structure for proper strength However infill percentage/patterns are not the only variable for creating strong parts Infill is really just a way to save time and material Here are some other ways to potentially increase strength Increase your shell Shell is the number of profile patterns per layer Typically in FDM/FFF each shell is about the diameter of your extruder nozzle Increase your floor/roof Similar to shell floor/roof refers to the number of layers that make up the bottom and top of the part with regard to the build plate Print orientation Pay attention to which areas of the part are susceptible to strain along the grain of the layers Try to rotate your part on the build plate in a way that minimizes potential failure both in print and post-print use Post process Don't be afraid to do some post-processing to increase the strength There are some 3D printers on the market that go as far as including Kevlar strands in the printing process to beef up their prints However it may be as simple as just coating the part in an epoxy with some basic finishing techniques It's a bit more work but it turns weak 3D printed parts into full production quality prints Update Based on some of the comments it sounds like your best bet might be to find a custom application that can either convert the g-code file into a solid model try CAM software or create a plugin for your CAD software I know Unigraphics NX and Solidworks allow for this and essentially recreate your own slicing engine that takes your solid model and generates the same infill pattern dynamically inside Perhaps look into the works of Simlab or similar which has a lot of 3D software plugins I'm not promoting them and I don't work for them this is just a reference of what to look for  Since I am not able to comment on this question yet I thought I would provide an answer in addition to the already helpful insight provided If the question in general is regarding infill percentage and the common follow-up regards part stiffness then it should be explained that choosing infill percentage is much more than just part stiffness Printing out tensile bars would be a great thing to have for educational purposes The bars should not only vary in infill percentages but in also the various infill patterns Depending on the type of stresses and loads applied different patterns may be stronger at lower infill rates for example Also the infill rate should correlate to the thickness of the bottom top and sidewalls This is especially important with ABS when it comes to shrinkage warping and delayering In order for the part to be universally as strong as possible as the part cools it must shrink evenly This is a well known factor for machinists creating molds for injection molding and casting Otherwise you may have unintended additional points of weaknesses arise Lastly if creating tensile bars make sure to take into account the shrinkage experienced along each axis for each individual example I would also suggest cutting each one open as well as attempting to break a few of the apart in a very crude way This could stimulate a lot of thought when designing a part before printing it  If you're an engineering class you may very well print out big cubes of different infils and test them  I could think of a way But it might require a few softwares to get everything done First get the CAD file Import to magics Materialise proprietary software There is a function for structures you can build your custom internal structure So add trusses etc Export stl There is one software which allows direct stl to step conversion I think its called Instep Or i think you could reduce mesh density and use FreeCAD to convert it back to step and run your analysis It would be intersting to see a report on the part Also there is no good way of simulating a 3d printed part Maybe the closest would be with composites  Anton I parse the G-code and build a finite element model and a thermal transient event to simulate the printing of the part followed by a structural simulation to determine the deformation and stress state in the resulting part This part could then be further analyzed with external loads to determine mechanical characteristics I use ANSYS software and the element birth amp death capability to activate a small volume of material per each thermal transient step The structural sim is static but also done at the same time steps as the thermal transient  You have to do it by eye However you need to think about what infill you use a triangle pattern will be very strong Following I never use high infill Most of my items have a strong outer shell IE 3 layers Inside I will do between 7 and 14 If I printed a square 200mm^3 I would have no concerns standing on it All depends Really though for your settings I would not thing you would really ever need more than 14 At a company I worked at that was testing 3d printed parts They evaluated material by printing the same test shapes and seeing what their tolerances were You will need to develop your own method as such ",
        "comments": "Thanks for link I'll check it out For engineering applications we need precise data at least it is required by project description Engineers can relay on some experiments and experience but it would be much more reliable source of information to slice your part and then by simulation prove that this parameters will withstand such a load.You could potentially print your own tensile bars and test different infill in-house However it will greatly depend with the source of the material and shell parameters.For bending loads which are the primary failure mode in real printed parts because they concentrate tension on the surface of the object where the layer lines present plentiful fracture initiation sites adding perimeters is significantly more impactful than adding infill This behavior is kind of masked in standard tensile tests but you'll see it in a four-bar bending test.Thanks for elaborating on perimeters I forgot to really emphasise thatOf course with bars it can be done by printing test bars But problem is that shapes are always different and there are no possibility to print thousands of test parts for each of projects So that I though about software which can simulate stiffness of already sliced part.@AntonOsadchy are you referring the various project parts are in shapes that are always different or that there is a distinguishable difference in how a 3D printer prints the same part ie a test bar If it's the latter you'd benefit from double checking your machine meets the requirements of your particular field idk what your tolerances are I have totally different orders with different requirements Shapes are always different because Mechanics of each of projects is unique And now we have just two options print solid if there is some mechanical load on part or 20-30 infill for housings cases and etc Some of parts for instance should not necessary be solid but there are no tool which can help to determine printing parameters for it so we print them solid spending more time and resources Thanks for update I'll definitely take a look and let you know how it will go The OP mentioned in some of the comments that testing is not feasible as new tests would need to be conducted for each new part The part geometry and requirements vary such that a few tensile bars would not cover the engineering requirements Perhaps elaborate on the process you mentioned to potentially aid others in the future?Wow That sounds very complicated and is probably a bit too advanced for most of our users It would be very interesting if you could tell us what you learnt from these simulations some rules-of-thumb and perhaps some statistics because not many people will be able to replicate this.Thanks man I have an experience with ANSYS so I can try it The only question is How did you imported g-code to Ansys simulation?This should be a comment.",

        "answers": " No there exists no software like that You can't communicate with a RAMPs board because a RAMPs board has no logic built-in it's just a dumb breakout board that connects the Arduino Mega to your printer's components such as stepper drivers MOSFETs for controlling heaters endstops If you wanted to connect a RAMPs board directly to your computer you'd need a way for your computer to generate the pulses that the Arduino normally generates You could potentially use a parallel port for this but you'd need many more outputs than a single parallel port can provide and you'd need to find a way to do the analog to digital conversion needed for the thermistors It's just not very feasible considering how few computers have parallel ports nowadays  The key question is not really if there is such software but rather if such software is possible or if it would work very well While a printer is more than just stepper motors those are one of the trickiest parts so it makes sense to look primarily at that Back in the old days of personal computing it was not uncommon to generate stepper motor signals from the CPU of a personal computer using individually settable bits on either a special purpose interface that is in fact basically how the head in a floppy drive was typically moved or borrowing another available interface such as a parallel printer port But then two things happened computers got faster but more isolated from the world and operating systems in common use became much more strict in what they permitted To move a high resolution stepper at a decent speed you need to generate either step pulses or winding activation signals at a fairly high rate And to accelerate and decelerate a motor under load you need to finely vary their timing Back when I/O ports hung directly off processor buses and operating systems could not prevent programs from speeding up the system hardware timer in order to run a stepper routine rapidly this worked to a degree But today Most PC class processors have little if any directly coupled I/O especially by the time you get outside the box An interface like USB is great for moving a large amount of data per unit time but it is absolutely horrible for accomplishing a trivial task with precise frequent timing it is a freight train not a bicycle courier Many of the things which let a processor internally operate quickly specifically work by decoupling it from an outside world that often cannot keep up memory caches bus exchange units etc If you do find a parallel port today it is likely to be on the far side of a PCI bus bridge at the least and have a different low-level interface than a legacy one Modern operating systems have a time-slice scheduler which owns the CPU(s and hands out small chunks of processing time to ordinary programs These programs typically get to run often enough to appear responsive to the user but not frequently enough to accurately drive stepper motors There are various schemes which have been tried for example to create a hard real time scheduler which owns the processor and allows a motor control task to register for precisely needed time slices then with whatever time is left over a Linux or Windows or similar kernel is allowed to run and divide up the remaining time among ordinary programs through its scheduling rules Of course such a scheme tends to need to be revised each time the utilized conventional operating system has a new major release While there are ways around these issues they tend to require atypical hardware and deep changes to the operating system installation making them neither inexpensive nor easy to setup for end users Instead it is generally simpler and more cost effective not even 10 these days to put an embedded processor on an external circuit board and have it act as a delegate to execute precise-timing tasks on behalf of the host processor Somewhat extending from the idea of industrial CNC machines that originally read punched paper tape and were later updated with a scheme where an ordinary computer drip feeds G-code commands over a serial port modern 3D Printers tend to deliver G-code or other command data a little bit in advance of when it is needed so that the latency of a USB or serial connection doesn't really matter Normally enough data is buffered on the printer for it to keep running but even if not it would only pause briefly between the complete moves which are transmitted not experience motor stuttering as it would if the USB were trying to deliver each individual step pulse As for why an Arduino probably mostly the history of who built the machines which kicked off the enthusiast printing trend If someone from an industrial background were tasked with building something like an FDM printer or a machine with similar motion needs in isolation today chances are they would end up with an ARM processor that would be a bit faster more flexible and with more resources and likely cost a little less But in actual history the early affordable machines were built by those in maker community who were already familiar with the availability of the Arduino and willing to put some cleverness into getting good motion out of its limitations RAMPS in particular seems designed to be a coarse-pitch through-hole bridge that a hobbyist could build themselves and then buy the slightly trickier to work with surface mount processor and motor drive chips preassembled in the form of an Arduino Mega and stepper drive modules That even fairly propriety machines maintain these basic parts choices is probably an indication of the utility of not reinventing the wheel if you want to develop a printer you can start from available components and customize them only one by one as you choose rather than not being able to run your development prototype until you get a working circuit board designed and fabbed a working software base developed etc ",

        "comments": "It would be helpful if you would provide what aspect of each of the methods was unacceptable For example is the problem with FDM that the part is out of dimension I think that's unlikely more likely that supports would be needed that FDM does not do well If you've tried SLA which provides automatic support was there a problem with residual powder What went wrong or is expected to be wrong with the various methods?The precision required in the ball for a ball valve to properly seal is greater than can be achieved with 3D printing Do you need it to seal properly or do you just want to verify the fit or something?It would be great if i could have it with the proto Or else I will have to keep a finger all the time i press a container its basically a one way valve for air If i press the valve closes and when i leave air is allowed to let in We have not really designed a valve like that before so the bigger concern would be that we get the design right for manufacturing.Why can't you seem to prototype it You're asking us what could be wrong but there's no description of the problem anywhere How are we supposed to know what's wrong without even seeing the model file or one of the resulting prints and why that print is bad Hey so its a 2mm ball and its supposed to act like a check/one way valve in theory it works FDM parts are too small or fragile I tried SLA but the ridges did not come in SLA Polyjet the support material is a problem My question is what should be the appropriate dimensions to get a ball valve working for such a setting(image shared above)Oh thanks Good to know its not possible so i dont need to spend more time looking for Any suggestions on the design Yea i know it has to be a cup Its supposed to be made in Injection molding How would it be assembled in production?I wouldn't say it's not possible but more not plausible with the current technology As far as suggestions you might consider creating a removable cover on the backside where the precision ball is and add a rubber washer to ensure an air-tight seal when you screw the cover on This allows you to insert/replace the precision ball However this may add some undesired complexity to the assembly of the part It all depends on how you balance the complexity of manufacturing vs intended use.so you see the rectangle thing on the part I was thinking of producing that separately and after pushing the ball in from the top i could close it with the rectangular slab However where I see the problem is I wont be able to put a cup shape design.Please see my updated answer for what I had in mind Keep in mind that there are many different ways to go about doing this and it depends a lot on the purpose of the part and intent on manufacturing process.This makes sense except i wont be able to use any of the screws os seals Its okay if it leaks a bit as long as reduced air flow I have updated an image showing the direction of airflow.The air passage would be opposite for me So i am guessing the silicone pad will be on the bottom It does seem like a nice workaround Any products which uses these?Pretty sure water floaties use this design.@albseb see edit in my answer@tbm0115 I would say that ball or cone is more often used with water devices than flap valve as the water is denser and it's easier to seal it with such valves A pressure of water column is also higher helping to seal the valve.Frankly apart from cutting edge cost is no concern settings any realistic item like this would be designed with the intended manufacturing process every bit as much in mind as the functionality If you 3d print a prototype you are basically adding the constraints of yet another manufacturing process on top of the original constraints of machining or injecting molding Think about how the part would be injection molded or see if you can design a version that can be easily machined by hand Or maybe you can use a small syringe as an insert in a crudely approximated housing.",

        "answers": " I think there are several factors involved in which sensors are best but the general ordering for me would be Hall Optical followed by mechanical All of the types will be subject to some drift due to vibrations and changes in the printer over usage Therefore it's the ease of adjustment as well as the accuracy of the stop which counts in the assessment In my experience the hall effect sensors are the most accurate and easiest They don't rely on physical switching as with the mechanical meaning there is no wear and tear on the component and the point of switching will remain fixed They have a potentiometer which can be adjusted to make the position of the stop change without any mechanical intervention allowing very fine tuning They can be very accurate Optical are similarly accurate but usually have a fixed component that cuts the beam to switch on/off the sensor The adjustment of the stop will usually be mechanical because the mount points will need to be adjusted this reduces their accuracy There are various adjustable mounts to alleviate this on thingyverse or the like Mechanical switches are similar to optical in terms of adjustment with the added inaccuracy of the actual switch mechanism which may degrade over time  If you take a look at the RepRap Wiki they briefly explain these three switches Mechanical Mechanical Endstops are the most basic form of endstops made of an ordinary switch two wires Changing the switch state signals the electronics Optical These Optical Endstops observe the light level and reacts to sudden changes Magnetic These endstops Hall effect sensors is a transducer that varies its output voltage in response to a magnetic field Hall effect sensors are used for proximity switching positioning speed detection and current sensing applications In regards to your question it's dependent upon your circumstance However most of the time a good ol Mechanical Switch is repeatable and serves its purpose well I personally would place both optical and magnetic switches in the category of a multifunction component Meaning both of these types of switches generally provide a valuable range for object detection This can potentially lead depending on your machine to a pushed command that tells your machine to slow down when it comes close to the soft stop Again personally I would be wary of using an optical endstop with potential white light noise from ambient room lighting or other sources I could be wrong in my concern for some modules that address these kind of issues So if we narrow down between mechanical and magnetic Magnetic would provide a gentler approach reducing potentially the amount of wear However I'm assuming magnetic switches require dialing in depending on the components used in the sensor This could lead to an undesired range that the sensor is triggered Mechanical switches are simple They're either touching or not touching on or off A possible pro or con is the ability to manipulate the trigger manually more easily I've run into a situation a few times where I needed to manually trigger the endstop as part of a troubleshooting step But if you accidentally bump your endstop while the machine is running no good  There are some different criteria that we should use to select a switch type Precision repeatability does the switch trigger at the same place every time How much spread is there in the trigger position Do environmental changes or machine setting changes affect the trigger position Contact distance does the switch register with enough clearance to its hard-stop that the homing axis can stop before colliding with something Noise-rejection does the switch ONLY trigger when it is supposed to It's important to ask how much switch precision do we actually need A typical 3d printer drivetrain using a microstepping stepper motor can only accurately position the moving load within one 1/16th microstep even if using finer microstepping than that due to error-inducing effects like friction torque and magnetic detent angle error That's around 0.01mm for most printers The homing switch only needs to be as precise as the motor's positioning Nothing is gained by having say 0.001mm precision endstops This precision of 0.01mm is achievable for all types of endstop switches with proper switch selection and configuration Then there are three standard switching types in use in consumer/hobbyist 3d printers Mechanical switches typically dual NO/NC limit switches which either pull up or pull down a signal pin by connecting an electrical circuit when triggered Optical switches which use transistors to detect when an obstacle flag is blocking the window between the emitter and sensor Hall effect switches which use transistors to detect when a magnetic field exceeds a particular field strength cutoff Mechanical Switches Precision/repeatability depends on the switch quality length of lever arm attached longer increases contact distance but is worse for precision and impact speed of the carriage with the switch It's possible to have a good mechanical switch or a bad mechanical switch This is typically a reasonable default choice because it is simple and cheap A small mechanical switch with a short lever arm or the lever arm removed will generally achieve the required 0.01mm switching precision Very cheap switches high contact speeds and long lever arms may provide inadequate resolution for Z homing or probing but will still be adequate for low-precision X and Y homing purposes Where mechanical switches tend to cause issues is in noise rejection Different controller boards use different ways of wiring the switch some use two wires and only send a signal when triggered When not triggered the signal wire is left floating or weakly pulled up by the microcontroller while attached to a long wire that acts as an antenna to pick up EM noise It is VERY common for heater or stepper wiring to emit nasty EMR due to the PWM current control Two-wire endstop cables should always be run away from stepper and heater wiring Shielding and twisting the conductors is a good idea too A more robust approach is to use three-wire switches that actively pull the signal line high or low depending on the switch position These will tend to reject noise better Very cheap mechanical switches may fail within the life of the printer However most limit switches are rated for millions of cycles which is unlikely to occur over any normal printer's lifespan Mechanical switches are easy to align and easy to trigger by hand during troubleshooting Optical Switches These rely on a flag blocking a window between a light emitter and a detector This is non-contact and can be quite reliable but introduces some challenges The exact trigger position and thus precision may depend on ambient light levels in the room because the sensor is monitoring for light to decrease below a specific intensity So it may be very repeatable/precise in the short term but have some drift if the sensor moves in and out of the sun through the day Switching tends to be more consistent and reliable if the flag enters the window from the side rather than the top Optical switches will actively pull the signal line high or low and thus have good electrical noise rejection Hall Effect Switches These measure the intensity of the nearby magnetic field and trigger when it exceeds a certain amount in a certain polarity This is highly precise/repeatable better than 0.01mm and extremely resistant to noise and environmental conditions Unless your printer is next to something that emits large magnetic fields anyway The hall switches I've seen have an adjustable trim pot to tune the trigger distance That's a nice feature when trying to manually calibrate a Delta or a Z-bed for first layer height The primary downside to hall switches is that they need a magnet to trigger the switch This can be difficult to trigger by hand during troubleshooting and requires attaching a magnet somewhere on the moving carriage Glue works fine but don't glue the magnet in place backwards  I don't think there is a simple answer In my opinion for a home sensor accuracy doesn't matter Firmware usually allows setting an offset between the indicated position and the actual position What really matters is repeatability Every time the sensor indicates position the position is the same Mechanical Switches I have found through testing several mechanical switches that the make event is less repeatable than the break event For best results I move toward the position that closes the switch then move in the opposite direction until the switch opens If I remember correctly I got make repeatability of about 0.02 o.5mm and break repeatability of about 0.005 0.13mm Optical Switches For a delta 3D printer I use optical sensors Optical sensors have a built-in illumination and sensor usually on opposite sides of a forked structure The sensor side has a slot which masks the light being received helping to shroud it from ambient light The slot is along an axis which is either aligned with the fork or normal to it The flag you use for the interrupter should completely cover the slot and for good repeatability edge of the flag must be parallel with the slot In other words some sensors expect the flag to enter from the side while other expect the flag to enter from the top Either will work but you need to choose the right sensor for the configuration of your machine Ambient Light with Optical Switches Perhaps ambient light could be a problem If so it could be addressed by shading the sensor Let's assume that the leds in the sensor are the same efficiency as the ambient LED lights For reference here is a spec sheet for a typical optical interrupter used in optical sensors http www.isocom.com/images/stories/isocom/isocom_new_pdfs/H21A.pdf The package of the optical sensor is designed to reduce susceptibility to ambient light Light intensity falls off as distance^2 and the illuminators in the sensor are very close How much effect does room light have on the sensor In my shop I use 8-foot LED replacement bulbs for the fluorescent bulbs With this I have 72 watts of LED lighting which let's say illuminate evenly the semi-sphere below the ceiling A full sphere is 12.56 sr steradians or stereo-radians so the half sphere is 6.28 steradians for a power of 11.46 w/sr At the sensor this must be divided by the square of the distance let's say 8 feet This gives us 11.46w/sr 96in^2 0.119w/area The illuminating led has a power typically of 1.2v 0.05a or 0.06w The light cone from a typical LED is about 30 degrees which is 1 sr for a power of 0.06w/sr Scaled for an estimate of the distance between the emitter and sensor of 4mm or 157 is 0.06w/sr 157in^2 2.43w/area It seems unlikely that general ambient light will be a problem If it were the sensor mounting could be designed to shield the sensor from direct exposure to ambient light It is important with optical sensors to be sure the interrupting flag is actually opaque to the illuminator light As I found red PLA is not especially opaque to infrared light so I needed to paint the flags with a black pigmented paint Hall Effect Switches I have no experience with Hall effect magnetic limit switches Other answers here have praised them because they have an adjustment which can be used to set the precise detection point I don t like adjustments because they drift Pots are subject to wear oxidation and both slow and fast variation in their resistance I would prefer to have something unadjustable and repeatable in hardware and use software to hold the calibration Example of Hybrid Choice On a 6-axis delta architecture CNC machine I build I use a hybrid approach to sensing home position Mechanical switches indicate a position that is close to home and the index pulse of a rotary encoder defines the precise home position the homing firmware moves toward home until the mechanical switch closes then away until it opens then back toward home until it detects the index pulse As there are six axes there are six sets of these switches and encoders Using a mechanical switch for the rough homing made sense for this machine because the index sensor is hit once per revolution so it is not a unique indicator of home and this machine creates a lot of dust and chips which could block an optical sensor So without an absolute answer my preference is for optical switches for repeatability  A separate issue not addressed in other answers is that the end stops for X/Y axes have different requirements than those for the Z axis X/Y Axes When the printer offers XYZ calibration like Prusa i3 MK2 the properties of the X and Y switches play a role since for the Z probing the probe should be centered above the fiducials copper circles in the bed The XY part of the calibration measures the position of the fiducials relative to the end-stop trigger point Then the Z calibration measures the height of each fiducial When the XYZ calibration is not offered there's usually no need for very repeatable positioning relative to the X and Y travel ends and on most printers you could simply move the motors until they start skipping steps and call that a day it will be accurate to within a few steps Z Axis The Z axis always has a high requirement on accuracy and repeatability and there are two general approaches to determining its position No end-stops on the Z-axis drive system a probe is mounted on the print head and is used to detect when the head is a certain distance above the print bed This can be used for 9-point calibration of the bed shape and thus removes the need for bed levelling End-stops used on the Z-axis drive system No sensor on the print head The bed needs to be separately leveled in reference to the nozzle thus the bed leveling screws Delta Z For Delta you essentially have three Z axis drivers and similar to the Cartesian XYZ drive you don't need any end-stops if you have a probe on the print head You can also perform multi-point bed leveling with such a probe

        "comments": "Do you know if this pushed command that tells your machine to slow down is used on any machine?I don't know of a real world use for 3D printing that's why I said it's a potential option I have seen similar setups in traditional CNC machining with a third party sensor The sensor does its thing and essentially pushes a G-Code command to the machine's controller Typically the command is a subroutine that performs multiple functions like moving the machine to a safe distance stopping and notifying the operator Look up Caron Engineering for an example with their TMAC setup.This doesn't answer the question which asks which endstops are the most precise There's nothing in here that addresses that this answer mainly seems to be theorizing about a gentler approach which isn't even supported by any firmware.@TomvanderZanden I'm purposely staying away from answering that part of the question as it is primarily opinion based.You could answer that part pretty objectively if you looked in some datasheets for the repeatability characteristics of various endstops.I don't see the Precision repeatability answered for the different switch types You name the effects that have influence though I think the question is if a good mechanic switch is more precise as an Hall Effect switch Or if ambient light makes an optic switch less precise than bad mechanical switch And what are the variations anyway Are we talking millimeters in difference or \u00b5m Some ball park values of the achievable precision would be needed to compare the three end stop types.It simply depends too much on the specific switch used to give a concrete answer In particular two different mechanical switches can have very different precision A cheap limit switch with a very long lever arm might be 0.5mm with a speed-dependent trigger position but that's unusually bad My experience is that all the typical endstop switches hall optical short-throw mechanical are equal or greater precision than the positioning resolution of a typical stepper motor drivetrain a 1/16 microstep or thereabouts and thus the exact trigger position repeatability is irrelevant.Let me add some detail to the answer to clarify this a bit.Nice answer however do you have any source for the precision of common switches being this high The statement use transistors to detect is a bit superfluous since just about everything uses transistors and transistors aren't really key to their operation RE large magnetic fields have you considered that the stepper motors themselves emit quite a bit of magnetism I found that once triggered my hall endstops stayed triggered due to the magnetic field of the motors and that to get them to untrigger I had to add a magnet of the opposing polarity close to them.Repeatability is far more important than precision The word precision indicates roughly how small a distance difference can be determined and you'd think there's no point in exceeding the stepper motor limit except that the bed itself can be adjusted far more precisely w the four corner bolts So if you can get super-tight repeatability you can home the bed itself to that position.Carl within the realm of science engineering and switch specification precision and repeatability are more or less synonymous The precision refers to the spread in the measurement values from measurement to measurement What you're thinking of is resolution.You've missed the induction sensors No those are not Hall Effect ones.While these are interesting points about endstops it doesn't address the actual question at all.Do you have any references to a delta running without endstops I'm fairly certain endstops are required to establish axis position otherwise the motion gets screwed up.Kinematically they are not required Similar to a double-Z-axis Prusa mount you start with a fairly middle-of-the-bed position then all three Z axes move down until the probe detects the first fiducial It's a large circle e.g 1 inch dia and establishes the Z and radial origin think of the bed in polar coordinates Second fiducial is a narrow sector and establishes the angular origin Now you can find further small fiducials to perform full Z calibration or full XYZ calibration after assembly For XYZ cal you need a Prusa-like custom bed For Z only a circular metal plate will do.",

        "answers": " You cannot make a safe coffee cup using home FDM printers There are no printable thermoplastics available to consumers/hobbyists that will reliably AND safely contain coffee/tea temperature beverages Even though some plastics may appear mechanically suitable at first sight there are long-term issues with using thermoplastics for elevated temperature service The material becomes weaker and less dimensionally stable under load as the temperature approaches the glass point of the polymer For example here is some Stratasys test data for ABS strength versus temperature Even if the plastic survives a few uses it may creep and warp over time And that might be fine depending on your needs People have printed working coffee cups out of ABS before For some definition of working you can make print a working coffee mug It's just not going to work at the level of longevity and reliability that people typically expect from hot beverage containers Imagine if the handle breaks and pours scalding liquid in your lap PLA in particular tends to give out abruptly due to its unusual ability to creep to ultimate failure with very low elongations Then there is the question of whether ANY FDM printed part is ever safe for repeated food service use One-time uses such as throw-away cookie cutters might be perfectly fine but repeated use introduces additional problems because FDM parts are porous They contain a microscopic void/grain structure that is perfect for trapping food debris and sheltering bacteria Every FDM part is similar in that regard to an old scratched wooden cutting board They are difficult to effectively sanitize A high-temp dishwasher cycle will do the job but that imposes significant thermal stress on thermoplastics Here's an example micrograph I took of voids in a printed part strands all aligned the same way to highlight the shape These voids will also allow liquids to leak unless careful print settings are used Over-extruding with multiple perimeters or doing some kind of post-print sealing can make water-tight parts It's not hard just takes some experimenting There is also considerable anecdotal evidence that much of the cheap filament from Asia is full of nasty toxic substances that may leach into hot beverages Heavy metals like lead strontrium and cadmium are often found in thermoplastics as processing aids pigments or simply from unscrupulous companies disposing of industrial ashes by mixing them into dark-colored filaments for export US-made and EU-made filaments seem to be better in this regard Now that the basic issues are out of the way Here is the breakdown of specific materials you might want to try PLA blends used in 3d printing will soften and fail almost instantly on contact with hot beverages They contain melt-reducers and viscosity modifiers and polymer molecular weights specific to FDM filament and will perform differently from injection-molded PLA products It is possible to anneal PLA to survive higher temperatures as this increases the crystallinity of the polymer and thus makes it more heat-stable However that is highly experimental and results will vary considerably with filament provider color/pigment and annealing process used Even annealed PLA is unlikely to survive long-term against very hot beverages and dishwasher use ABS will become fairly weak at hot beverage temperatures It may survive use for a while but is quite weak and will slowly creep with very hot beverages or in a high-temp dishwasher ABS IS approved for food use in many contexts despite what many people think but hot beverages are not one of the approved uses PET blends are chemically a pretty good choice soda bottles are PET but generally have glass points around 70-75C and thus will be weak or fail outright at hot beverage temperatures It is also important to ask what is being blended into the PET For example PETG is glycol modified but filament vendors do not share any details about this or reveal how it may affect the polymer's leaching behavior Most nylons will creep under load at surprisingly low temperatures perhaps 50-55C depending on the blend Nylons are also attacked by acids and will absorb stains and smells from coffee Nylons also tend to swell/shrink quite dramatically on exposure to water so mechanical fit and general shape of nylon parts may not be stable enough even for cold beverage service Taulman's 910 is probably a good candidate for hot beverage service due to its high working temperature but acid attack from coffee exposure may still be an issue in the long run It's worth trying Polycarbonate is thermally stable even in boiling water so mechanically it is fine but PC leaches BPA one of the monomers left over from manufacture into hot liquids High-temp exotics like Ultem and PEEK aren't printable by consumer/hobbyist printers at the size scale required for a coffee mug They simply warp too much unless you have an oven for a heated build

        "answers": " I would consider getting another aluminum build plate for the following reasons Lightweight Aluminum is a very lightweight metal making it suitable for most machines that have injection molded platform arms This reduces potential sagging of the arms and overall load on the Z axis stepper motor Conductivity Referring to this simple Google search for heat conductivity aluminum is significantly more conductive than steel 205 vs 43 respectively with copper at about double that of aluminum Availability Aluminum is already a widely used material for 3D printing so finding one will be relatively easy and probably cheaper than having a steel build plate custom made In conclusion I personally would not recommend using steel for your build plate as aluminum seems to have the most benefits Yes steel will be more rigid and durable but I don't think that these should be variables that are significantly more beneficial over aluminum  Whether you should use steel or aluminum depends on the construction of your print bed stack Either will work but there are trade-offs involved Various considerations that may come into play A flat sheet of aluminum has better stiffness/weight ratio than a flat sheet of steel If weight/mass is a concern such as with a Mendel style moving Y-bed aluminum may be superior to an equivalent stiffness steel sheet On the other hand steel has the superior stiffness/thickness ratio so if the total thickness of the plate is constrained such as by the printer's mounting hardware steel may be higher performance In short for sheets of equivalent stiffness aluminum will be thicker but lighter That may or may not matter for your specific printer Differential thermal expansion can be an issue depending on what the plate is attached to For example rigidly bolting a steel sheet to an aluminum sub-frame will cause the structure to warp when its temperature changes Likewise for bolting an aluminum sheet to a steel sub-frame Bed mounts that float will not cause warping in either case All kinds of rolled sheet metal may have a tendency to warp when heated/cooled due to residual stresses and grain alignment effects from manufacture When people want extreme dimensional stability for the flattest and lowest-warp print bed possible an aluminum cast tooling plate material such as MIC 6 is usually used The MIC 6 sheet is then precision ground to be flat Of course that adds cost Neither aluminum nor steel is a particularly good bare print surface Either will need some kind of adhesion layer like Kapton tape or gluestick The adhesion layer matters far more than the type of metal underneath Aluminum sheets are often used as heat-spreaders to even out the bed temperature of heated beds This is very important when heaters are smaller than the total bed size or have hot spots Most heaters do have hot spots Steel is a relatively poor conductor of heat so the surface of the bed will take longer to heat up and will be less even That may or may not be an issue depending on the printer and desired materials So it's really a holistic design decision Aluminum is far more common because of its thermal properties and lower weight but steel print beds particularly with permanent adhesion coatings are often used too ",

        "answers": " SHORT ANSWER You're not supposed to do the single-wall perimeter thickness test to calibrate Simplify3D That screws up the extrusion volume The correct volume calibration procedure for S3D is Measure actual average filament diameter and input that Print a 100 infill calibration cubes If the print is over-extruded top or sides bulging decrease Extrusion Multiplier by about 0.05 and try again If the print is under-extruded or looks clean increase Extrusion Multiplier by about 0.05 and try again Repeat as needed to dial it in The correct value of Extrusion Multiplier is the largest value that does not produce over-extruded prints This produces minimum void volume and strong parts In the future that specific material+extruder combination will always have the same extrusion multiplier You only need to measure and input filament diameter and you will always get accurate volume output And if you use high-quality filament with consistent diameter you don't even really need to measure the diameter If you really want to measure perimeters you can do 3 perimeters and divide the measurement by 3 That takes into account most of the overlap and will be much closer to accurate than a single-perimeter measurement COMPLETE ANSWER The goal here is to fill the print volume as completely as possible at least in the solid parts of the print like perimeters roofs and floors Empty space between strands doesn't contribute to part strength In fact voids act as failure initiation sites by concentrating stresses Because extruded strands come out with rounded edges they have to be overlapped to squeeze plastic into gaps and minimize corner voids That looks like this Where the bulges overlap the excess plastic gets pushed into the corners to mostly fill the voids It's very difficult to get 100 packing density but you can get pretty close if you calibrate volume correctly You DO NOT want to space the strands without overlap That makes very weak prints and looks like this To get the right amount of strand overlap the slicer has to do some math and make some assumptions about how you're calibrating it This is not uniform between software packages So it's important to understand what extrusion width means to different slicers For a couple prominent examples Slic3r treats extrusion width as the measured outside dimension of a stack of strands Adjacent strands are then positioned closer together than the nominal width according to a somewhat complicated equation to get sufficient overlap for bonding S3D treats extrusion width as the average width of the stack of strands which is the equivalent width if the plastic strands were extruded as ideal rectangles instead of a stack of ovals Adjacent strands are positioned 1x nominal extrusion width apart That provides the correct amount of overlap without any extra math But each individual strand is really somewhat wider than the nominal width Both of these techniques can produce the exact same output if calibrated properly but they require different calibration techniques because they calculate the plastic volume and adjacent strand spacing different ways It's important to understand that S3D spaces its strands 1x extrusion width apart When you use the measured perimeter thickness to calibrate Simplify3D for extrusion width setting measured thickness you get under-extruded prints with no strand overlap S3D's strands must measure wider than the width setting to get the correct overlap In practice S3D's code is smart enough to know how this affects print dimenions and will adjust perimeter positions to get accurate overall dimensions But single-wall test boxes will be thicker than expected The downside to the way Slic3r calculates volume is that it is only accurate for strands that are shaped like ovals And that is only an accurate assumption when extrusion width nozzle width layer height The strand must be wide enough for molten plastic to flow sideways and develop the circular bulge cross-section So people almost always print with wider strands in Slic3r than is strictly necessary The volume calculations don't work all that well with thin strands Whereas S3D's volume calculation method works fine with pretty much any extrusion width greater than layer height and greater than nozzle diameter There are pros and cons to both systems You just need to understand the correct calibration technique for each ",
        "comments": "Thanks for your answer it is really great Don't you think that approach of S3D is less scientific because there we need to relay on our eye but measuring perimeter in Slice3r we can get nice exact calibration result which can be used by software to get really precise prints Another think I'll need to explain students how to calibrate amount of plastic extruded and it will be pretty hard for them to suggest when it is good enough to go.Slic3r's method assumes a specific extrusion strand shape which is only 95 correct under specific combinations of slicing settings and not correct at all with other combinations of settings It will push the wrong volume of plastic in those conditions S3D's method is empirical but works great over a wider range of conditions It's a trade-off.Whether the top of the cube bulges up is a pretty easy metric to explain to people I think.",

        "answers": " I've encountered this on my Replicator Dual in the past I was only using MakerBot branded ABS filament so it wasn't a quality issue for me What I found was that the delrin plunger design that helps keep the filament in contact with the drive gear wasn't actually helping So I installed the newer assemblies that use a spinning bearing to contact with the filament Install or keep installed a spring loaded extruder assembly When feeding filament loosen the spring and gradually tighten until the filament begins feeding on its own Try to stay close to the recommended print temperatures for the material ABS is typically somewhere around 225C but it depends on the supplier Ensure your filament is stored in a dry place This is way more of an issue for PLA but it doesn't hurt to keep your material protected If it continues perhaps swap out the drive gear itself If you've dropped your motor or somehow a burr has developed on any of the teeth naturally the burr will cut away the material Gears are very temperamental and should be considered a consumable  After disassembling the extruder mechanism I tracked the issue down to a clogged extruder though not in the way I'd expected A previously common method to drop filament down to the hot end and create a heat-break between the heater and the extruder gear was the use of a PTFE Teflon sleeve Over time this sleeve can become clogged by filament that has melted and degraded/carbonized sticking to the nonstick walls This creates a bottleneck for the new filament preventing smooth extrusion My printer came with two replacement tubes Swapping those in for the old clogged tubes resulted in instantly improved printing sorta like getting a new printer Print temperatures are back to normal and everything operates fine I was also able to drill out the carbonized filament from the old sleeve though I doubt I'll reuse it I found replacement sleeves on Amazon here and an alternative all-metal extruder assembly manufactured by Micro-Swiss I'm not sure if you'd run into clogging issues on the all-metal one so perhaps staying with the PTFE tubes and replacing them occasionally is a better way to go ",

        "answers": " If you have a heated bed bring the bed up to a reasonable temperature then do as best as you can to create rapid cooling If you can remove the bed heated or not consider to place it in a freezer or refrigerator Obviously if the bed is heated you'll want to handle the bed carefully and not place it on anything in the freezer that could be damaged while it cools Unrealistically pour liquid nitrogen over the bed This may crack the bed and/or the model as well as be all the more dangerous for unprotected users  I would do as fred_dot_u initially suggested by increasing the bed temp or using a hair dryer to heat the BuildTak Then use a small fan to quickly cool the platform or at least quicker than room temperature An ice pack on the build plate/part could also work This drastic fluctuation between the build platform or BuildTak and the part should make it easier to remove the part This works because the temperature coefficient is going to be different between the build plate BuildTak and the 3D printed part So each part rises and falls in temperature at different rates When objects are heated and cooled they expand and contract respectively Essentially as each object expands and contracts at different rates the objects begin to separate A good example is if you've ever placed a jar into the fridge/freezer to make it easier to open Typically the jar is glass and the lid is either plastic or metal You'll notice that the lid is significantly easier to open as opposed to its original state because the lid and the jar physically react differently to temperature changes Also here is a good article explaining a few different ways to remove a stuck part for prosperity sake here's a quick list Brute force Just try to yank on it until it pries off Sharp objects Try using a small blade to get under a corner of the part and wiggle the part a bit Careful not to break the blade and send it flying Utilize temperature difference I already explained this above Use solvents I didn't know this but apparently there are solvents in the market that are targeted for 3D printing maintenance Essentially its just an alcohol-based liquid Use floss Another cool idea that's related to using a sharp object using dental floss Basically any small object that you can remotely wiggle under the part and give you more leverage to yank on it Invest in a flexible build platform I've personally heard some mixed reviews on these in present day of 2016 But material science is getting better every year so who knows what will be available soon ",

        "answers": " It will be very difficult to find a recycling facility that will accept your 3D prints because they're mainly set up to handle packaging material which constitutes the vast majority of plastic waste such as bottles If you sent your 3D prints to your municipal recycling programme they would at best sort it out from the packaging material and incinerate it and at worst it would contaminate a batch of recycled plastic of a different type You might be able to find a recycling company that specializes in recycling the plastics used in your printer but given the extremely low volume involved it is not worth their or your time to handle it You should discard your prints as household waste and offset your environmental impact some other way by paying for some trees to be planted or investing in renewable energy this would be a more viable use of your time and resources  The obvious answer is re-grinding the prints and making more filament Unfortunately this isn't yet a very economical or simple operation A decent filament extruder capable of holding acceptable diameter tolerances is around 1000 and even then they can be pretty fidgety to operate You have to have a LOT of volume throughput in your filament extruder for regrinding to be an economical proposition Some of the reasons why recycling prints into filament can be difficult Most plastics will degrade to some extent each time they are extruded Both by the 3d printer and by the filament extruder PLA will thermally degrade with extended exposure to heat PET will hydrolyze and break down if not meticulously dried to remove moisture prior to heating to the melting temp PETG seems to be less prone to hydrolysis damage than plastic bottle PET but it still happens to a limited degree ABS holds up to extrusion conditions better than most which is part of why it's favored for injection molding but there's still the potential to affect properties by depleting additives or cooking out plasticizers In practice this means regrinds generally need to be mixed with fresh pellets at some ratio That dilutes the degraded or additive-depleted polymer with good material so you can maintain the material properties and performance If you print a variety of different colors and don't want all your recycled filament to mix and end up a muddy brownish color it can be difficult to manage the color sorting and matching Most people don't want different colors along the length of a spool either So the regrind has to be mixed evenly in with virgin pellets and a suitable amount of masterbatch colorant to get a reasonable color output You're not going to run off a new spool with 95 virgin pellets just to recycle a 50 gram failed print are you Likewise for material matching Mixing materials is a bad idea If you only print white PLA this is all pretty easy to manage But if you print a variety of colors and materials you've got to set up a material tracking sorting and storage operation You can do it it's just a hassle Diameter control is difficult 3D printers need a fairly tight diameter control for reliable performance and good quality This is really the key challenge in any filament extrusion process Extruded polymers like to change shape as they extrude and cool due to molecular alignment effects You can't just push molten plastic out a 1.75mm nozzle die swell will make the extrudate bulge to a larger diameter immediately upon exiting the nozzle Then you have to actually pull on the soft filament as it cools to carefully draw it down to the right diameter The way the filament extruder measures diameter and controls tension is the key to getting acceptable results Most hobbyist/desktop filament extruders have not succeeded at this Those are just the major issues Filament extrusion is a complex subject with a lot of depth For a home user of 3d printers making filament basically becomes a whole second hobby In my opinion it only really makes sense in a commercial production printing environment where paid technicians can run the extruder(s and a very large print throughput makes the pellets+regrind economics much more favorable than just buying new filament Reducing and reusing are preferable to recycling Making your printer more reliable and gaining experience with calibration/configuration will reduce the volume of waste produced There are also some productive uses that let you reuse unwanted prints as-is or downcycle them for productive uses I personally keep a box of failed prints and calibration prints and no-longer-needed prototypes as showpieces for people who want to learn about 3D printing and as toys for my nieces and nephews I strongly recommend doing your calibration prints with a toy calibration model like Benchy or CaliBlocks 3D printing is still new enough that people will happily take dozens of Benchies off your hands for the novelty value Failed and unwanted prints can also be used around the workshop for shims sacrificial cushions when clamping or hammering or drilling or as scrap for experimenting with adhesives or post-processing techniques ABS scraps are good for making ABS-slurry as a print bed adhesion treatment layer or for solvent-painting and filling gaps in other prints Unfortunately most other filaments do not have such convenient and safe solvents Some people have experimented with putting piles of scrap prints on a cookie sheet in an oven and melting them into multicolor cutting boards There's a lot you can do with this sort of heavy remelt plate if you get creative I personally wouldn't use cheap Asian filaments for food contact though they often have unpleasant contaminants  At Chaos Computer Club summit in Winter there was a talk from a Maker who recycled by himself How can be 3d printing a dual use technology Print more things produce less waste save money You can see the talk here https media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7321-re_cycle Update At Fabcon3D in

        "comments": "Thanks for the advice But why would you not use the circuit board tracks They are obviously there for that very purpose.I disagree with this answer It's nowhere near this critical and thermistors are by far not this sensitive Using the bed tracks is perfectly fine The purpose of giving a thermistor very thin legs is so that it has less heat capacity and thus responds to temperature changes more quickly but given the bed as a whole already has an extremely large heat capacity anything the thermistor's leads add is completely irrelevant.@TomvanderZanden I'm a bit confused about what you say You do confirm that legs are thin to reduce heat capacity which implies it's is relevant parameter but then you say it's fine to stick thermistor to heating element and you say it's not relevant It's contradiction isn't it It's not a contradiction The legs are thin so the thermistor can respond quickly when the temperature is changing quickly As the temperature is not changing quickly in this application the heat capacity of the bed is too large for the temperature to change quickly whether the legs are thin or not becomes irrelevant.But hot legs and hot wire can be significant component of a measurement Thermistor wil not measure where it's supposed to And again you've said it has thin legs and wires to respond quickly but you suggest to connect it to thick and capacious tracks which are hot in fact IMO this will have influence on the process of measuring The temperature of those tracks is exactly what you're trying to measure Well strictly speaking you want the temperature of the bed surface but the two are coupled closely enough that it doesn't matter Many people just place the thermistor on the underside of the heated PCB with the PCB separating the thermistor from the build surface and seem to have no trouble with that You don't need measurements that are accurate to 0.1 of a degree.I would use a heatsink plaster instead of thermal grease Plaster solidifies and sticks to what it is applied to grease doesn't.Yep the difference of temperature from the edges to the center is around 20C however in the center area it is pretty much the same Here are some thermal images to prove this http www.sd3d.com/not-all-heated-beds-are-created-equal So unless you decide to put the thermistor very far from the center it doesn't matter.How fast do temperature changes in the center propagate to the edges My main argument for placing the thermistor near the center would be that its reading will more quickly reflect changes from the heat plate making the whole control system more responsive resulting in the bed keeping its temperature more consistent.@mhelvens That's where your PID tuning comes in If you place the thermistor near the edges the system will have a greater tendency to oscillate by the time the edges reach the setpoint the center will have overshot by a great amount but that's exactly what PID tuning is for the tuning accounts for the fact there is some delay.The tracks or wire only matter because a they contribute a little resistance to the circuit and b that resistance changes with temperature But that resistance is in the ballpark of an ohm and copper changes resistance by about 0.39 that is 0.0039 per degree C The thermistor is about 100,000 ohms Thermistor resistance change varies a lot but is typically 100 to 1000 ohms per degree C A change of 0.39 of 1 ohm in a circuit changing by hundreds of ohms per degree C simply doesn't matter",

        "comments": "Right that's what I'm doing now But if for some reason I'd like a different first layer height it seems like something slicers could support If for example we want nuzzle height above the bed to be 60 of first layer height we would only need to tell the slicer that the probe is calibrated for 200 microns and it could deduce the proper height for 100 and 300 automatically But I don't think slicers support this Of course perhaps the equation isn't that clear-cut.Really With a print surface like BuildTak it seems to be a very delicate balance between a print sticking too much and a print being too loose It usually takes some playing around with wrenches for me to get the perfect bed adhesion.Bed leveling all points on the bed surface being the same height is different from what you asked.Yes Where did I mention bed leveling?when you say you have to play around with wrenches all I can assume you mean is moving the nuts up and down of the 3 or 4 screws on the edges of the bed which determine bed levelingNope I meant moving the z-probe up and down.Honestly not such a very delicate balance for me.",

        "answers": " It is hard to tell whether you personally should enclose your printer However you asked for the advantages and I will name some of them on which one can base a decision A 3D printer enclosure helps to keep the temperature of the whole print at controlled levels if you use a heating element thermocouple and pid regulator This is one of the most direct uses of the enclosure which can be achieved by almost no other means One could sloppily say it does for the whole print what the heatbed does for the initial layers Controlling the temperature can be beneficial for layer adhesion and can help against delamination problems This can go as far as fixing cracks and complete delamination Thanks to J Roibal for bringing these cracks to my attention in the comments keeps dangerous fumes controlled Here you can find a scientific study about it published in Atmospheric Environment 79 titled ultrafine particle emission from desktop 3D printers on exactly that topic You can embed a filter with a fan in your housing to filter the air from all dangerous fumes that are created when melting certain plastic types It could just circulate the air inside the chamber or get the filtered air out of the housing This is another use which cannot be achieved otherwise afaik can keep humidity away from your printer This is helpful for filaments that attract water and don't print well under that circumstance This should be realized separately for stored filament too adding some silica gel to regulate humidity Thanks to Obmerk Kronen in the comments minimizes losses of your heatbed This happens in at least two ways the heated bed will also heat the surroundings that is the inside of the enclosure By raising its temperature the temperature difference and hence heat loss is minimized Also wind introducing high fluctuations in the transfered i.e lost heat is minimized In that sense it also shuts out any wind for print temperature stability Also dust and particles that could be blown on the print will be shut out thanks to the addition of dust/particles Obmerk Kronen This is a benefit that comes without having a heated chamber or filter helps to keep the printer clean in between use Your axes will thank you being free from dust reduces smell and noise If you use the printer in you living area that alone can be a great benefit makes sure that your printer is safe during storage nothing will fall on it can look pretty nice and add to the style of your printer even if selfmade There are obviously also downsides as connected work/money to make it increased space used for the printer and if not well made for that purpose which it should be increased difficulty in repairs and maintenance of the printer itself i.e to get the printer out of the enclosure  kamuro provided an excellent answer so I'll just try to add by playing devil's advocate Possible things to look out for Inappropriate enclosure could result in more temperature differences resulting in higher rates of warping and delamination For example if you do not enclose the top of your machine then the temperature at the beginning of your print will be potentially different than further into the print Post-print delamination/warping The same can be said for a printer without an enclosure But if you are too eager to remove the print directly after printing you run the risk of essentially air quenching the part Instead let the part sit in the warmer ambient temperature and become fully solid again Enclosures are not a fix-all Enclosures are merely a means of reducing variability in your process As an operator you should still fine-tune your process by finding the right extruder/HBP temperatures and quality materials to ensure repeatable quality prints kamuro touched on this a bit but difficulty performing maintenance Speaking from experience removing acrylic panels from a machine not designed to have an enclosure is pretty annoying However this could be alleviated with a better design I chose to bolt my panels to my machine but a snap design would fair better Specifically adjusting my belt tension became very difficult on my Replicator Dual after adding acrylic panels Don't make it too hot I made a rookie mistake after adding an enclosure to my machine by using a space heater in the room next to the printer The space heater oscillated and occasionally directed the heat at the machine After a few failed prints I noticed that the extra ambient heat in the room was causing the ABS arms for my HBP to warp under the heat/weight of the HBP The enclosure wasn't the root cause but it helped trap the extra heat inside the machine  People add a passive heated chamber when they are printing in ABS However I personally think the best reason to have a custom chamber is so you can add an air filter Adding an air filter will reduce your exposure to fine air particulates It is generally considered a bad idea to breath in particles from plastic For PLA you will not want an air chamber If you want to do an air scrubber they you will need air input to avoid the heat chamber from getting hot On that note as we see in the z18 PLA can benefit from an Active heat chamber but you will have to figure out what the optimal temp is ",

        "answers": " Typical FDM desktop 3D printers might struggle with this model as it requires you to either print large overhangs and use support structure when printed laying down or lacks a natural flat bottom surface to get good print adhesion when printed upright A couple of suggestions Some FDM printers are great at printing support and some even allow you to print dissolvable support structure If you find one of these you are home safe You could split the model in two print those parts separately and then glue them together afterwards This is quite common for complex models and allows you to print your model on even basic FDM printers Tom's answer illustrates this well There are naturally other 3D printer technologies too SLA resin etc but I have no practical experience with these myself and leave it up to others to give you a good answer regarding these  The existing answer seems to suggest printing the model in the orientation as shown e.g with the Z-axis of the part corresponding to the Z-axis to the printer with either support or splitting it in half Using supports in this way is a bad idea because it will leave a very rough surface finish due to the geometry and be very hard to remove unless you want to deal with troublesome support material The model also will have no contact with the build plate at all making it very likely that it will detach even when you're using support you want a reasonable amount of surface area making contact with the build plate You'd have to drill out the hole in the middle since support can not be removed there The approach of splitting it in half and printing in this orientation isn't ideal either because the surface finish will again be very rough due to the very gentle curves of the star The hole in the middle will also turn out a bit deformed and flattened and require support Instead for this model a much better approach is to split it like this The top half has no overhang at all and the bottom half only has gentle overhangs that are easy to print without support The surface finish will be much better compared to printing in the other orientation Moreover the hole can also be printed in the XY plane leaving it cleaner as well ",

        "answers": " I would say it's not the best approach In the situation you've described I would rather install some kind of vertical ring a bit above your printer This ring would organize your filament going from any direction So let's assume you got one spool on the right and one on the left of your printer both are 1m away from the printer itself If you get filament and put throught the ring then to your extruder In my opinion the ring should be around 15 20cm over the printer it should have around 10 15cm diameter and spools should not be too low The only issue I see is unwinding spools which are too far from the printer because then filament would be unwinded angular but the same issue would be with and without teflon tube edit Here is a simple change of your design edit2 Please also note that you can assure proper angle of unwinding filament by installing small rings eyes next to spools These eyes will direct filament out of spool and then filament will turn to your big ring mounted on the printer This is common solution in textile industry  Yes this is feasible You should constrain the tube at both ends this prevents the spool from pulling up on the extruder This approach is known as reverse bowden setup  This shouldn't be too much of an issue as long as You guide the filament properly to avoid breakage at both ends as Tom mentions You avoid too much friction between the pulling extruder motor and the spool itself You mention that you consider using a 1-2 meter teflon tube to guide the filament Although this might work long teflon tubes will increase the friction from pulling the filament Furthermore I really doubt having such a long tube will be beneficial at all quite on the contrary I think it could be rather impractical Most likely having simple guides at both ends whether its tube stubs or rings will suffice  This is somewhat similar to a question I asked a while back Pay attention to Ryan Carlyle's response in the question I posted His post essentially explains various ways that guide tubes may hinder extrusion due to drag In regards to the length of your guide tubes ensure that the tube is relatively straight If you are holding the filament above the machine chances are that you wont really need the tubes anyways and the distance between the spool and the extruder won't matter either The point of tube is to ensure the filament doesn't bind coming from the back of the machine thus potentially clogging your extruder Update Based on the OP's drawing I think it would benefit to change the design to drop the tubes all together The tubes can provide many point of contact and managing so many lines at once may become problematic So possibly drop the tubes and intend on not drawing your filament unless they are fed into the extruder You could install smaller ends of tubes at either end of assembly one at the storage rack the other above the extruder to ensure the filament is being fed/pulled straight The space between the storage rack and the machine doesn't matter Here's a basic edit of your design that might be easier to manage For kicks here's a design I made for my own machine as a quick-change design  Your idea is actually good but i would add some edits to it First of all to keep your equipment clean you would like to add little foam rubbers to clean the filament at the entrance of the tubes to clean out the dust that will be accumulating over the rolls Another thing that i would recommend is to hang the tubes on a separate support for them and not on the extruder head as it would add some additional friction to it and can cause the 3d model with additional friction making it distorted  I would like to add to the already great discussion that this general approach is prone to filament degradation by water intake That is if you are using filament for which this is an issue PLA as the most prominent example Also your goal is to exchange more quickly that is without un mounting whole spools each time Basically you want to have a multi-filament spool holder if I understand correctly If you design an enclosed box with a single outlet you could incorporate silica gel inside and a reduced effort to swap the filament I would still avoid a nice free-hanging spool solution due to the degradation issue ",
        "comments": "Thanx Tormod Acording to my experience tube longer than 1m is not a good idea 1 it's harder to pull/push filament 2 such long/heavy tube has influence on movement of the caret 3 it's uncomfortable to install/uninstall filamentI absolutely agree Darth I'm not sure I understand your proposed setup with the ring Would it be too much trouble to ask for a quick mockup image like the one I added to the question What do you mean by constrain the tube at both ends Are you simply suggesting that neither end should hang loose Please have a quick look at the image I added to the question to see if it matches your meaning.Even if the spools hang above the printer which is the plan I feel like things might go wrong if the extruder tries to pull filament from the spool at an awkward angle Anyway the answer you're referring to is useful Thanks!Aha Guides at both ends rather than a tube all the way I can see the sense in that Now that I think about it other answers like darth pixel's may also have hinted at this.And the issue of pulling filament at an angle and expecting the spool to keep up is the reason I'm suggesting tubes If the filament angle is properly guided at the source I don't see that as a problem Thoughts?Thank you for uploading your sketch it helped understand more of what you're trying to achieve 1@mhelvens I believe that both Tom and Darth hinted at this Whether it's a tube or rings probably doesn't really matter that much Fantastic approach and I really like the possibilities that this idea creates My questions How would the printer know to swap filaments and which filaments to swap potentially written into the G-Code How will the printer swap the filament In answer to the second question I am envisioning some type of cutter which then melts fuses the second filament to the first but how can this be accomplished in a uniform fashion Anyways I think this is a fantastic idea I'll be watching this thread closely Contact me if I can help in any way.@J.Roibal Your interpretation is a bit more ambitious than my actual idea I was still thinking of swapping filaments manually just minimizing the time and effort required This would certainly help you to hot-swap filaments during a print but I currently have no plans to fully automate this I know about another recent project http www.mosaicmanufacturing.com you may be interested in But it's a bit more pricey than what I have in mind.my heavens mhelvens I can totally see how this could become automated removing the necessity of dual-extruder 3-d printers while adding the capability to print in dozens of colors and types of materials automatically.@J.Roibal Sure I can see that too And I may automate the process in the future But it would be a hobby project as this is and I would not achieve the precision required for multi-color prints Developing that technology would be a full-time effort because it is more complicated than you might think Anyway as I hinted in my previous comment the technology you want does already exist Have a look at the Palette http www.mosaicmanufacturing.com I wish I could afford one.@J.Roibal The Palette splices multiple filaments into a single stream as you suggest The problem is that colors mix together in the hot-end To get crisp color-swaps they build a transition tower on the side of the main print to purge the mixed plastic The solution we're talking about here would work differently For every swap it would retract the current filament and start extruding another This would probably evolve into multiple Bowden extruders feeding the same hot-end and might not produce as much waste Sounds like a fun project But I do have a day job Can you discuss your improvements further I am interested in the maintenance portion of your answer in particular.@mhelvens please take a look on my post edit Please also note that rings can be used on both sides of the design Thanx Tormod You can apply little eye next to the spool which will assure the filament is unwinded at proper angle then there could be a loooong way to the ring proposed by me of course on that way there could be even more rings which will direct filament properly assuming you are pulling which you doYes this matches what I mean Without the tube the force required to get the spools to unwind is transferred to the extruder possibly moving it around and decreasing print quality With the tube in place that force is instead applied to the mount of the tube.@DanBoyko I'd be interested to see you finish that last sentence A good point An enclosed box would definitely be a good move This also seems to be an argument in favor of tubes all the way rather than short filament guides on both ends I don't understand your box with a single outlet plan though I don't see the point and it would probably complicate filament swapping because I'd have to open up the spool enclosure to feed a new strand through the tube Right now I'm still inclined to run a bunch of separate tubes to slightly above the extruder like in my mockup image.@TormodHaugene Actually tube v.s rings makes a difference A tube has the advantage I mentioned in my answer rings don't.Yes if you can get the tubes somewhat airtight or don't use the first part of the filament each time you swap your idea works better Why wouldn't you want the whole box very close to the printer so that you wouldn't need the individual tubes altogether Having 5 tubes being moved by the carriage is additional load to the motor that doesn't benefit the print itself.The placement of the spools is purely a matter of constraints in the printer-room It turns out the spools would have to be at a distance of about 50cm Moreover as J Roibal has suggested in a comment it may be fun to try to fully automate filament swapping some day I'd definitely need individual tubes for that Would multiple tubes really add significantly to the load I'll have to experiment.The load may depend on how the tubes are directed to the printer I had a problem when building a repstrap as soon as the bowden tube was attached the motor wouldn't move anymore Truth be told it was a tiny cd laser carriage drive motor but but it moved flawlessly without the tube You can easily find out how much you have to increase the current at the border to losing steps I would guess that it doesn't influence your printer too much watch ghosting but if it can be easily avoided why shouldn't one think about it when designing Fully automated sounds like real fun Interesting idea Sadly you are overthinking it At the hackerspace we have plenty of setups like this but we do not bother with tubes Just hang it and go @StarWind Could you link me to some examples perhaps With pictures descriptions?Yeah so it is the guys who make the Flexon extruder here is their site with photos http diabasepe.com/i am really sorry don't know why it cut the answer i was about to say that i would damage the 3d model with additional friction making it distorted",

Minimal speed/torque requirements compared to subtractive machine tools Good designs focus on temperature control via enclosures and/or electronics Typically uses heat block/nozzle/stepper motor to control material size/flow Software Emphasis on plug-n-play UI/UX Conceptually easier to generate tool paths STL's provide outlines and software fills in the blanks like a coloring book Focus is on understanding material properties and temperature variability Common Variability Material quality/shape Environment temperature CNC Mills/Routers/Lathes Hardware Maximum speed/torque requirements Good designs focus on rigid designs and handling harmonics Tighter tolerance components to ensure mechanical repeatability Relies on cutting tool size/shape to control material size/flow Software Requires more manual input typically to account for where its tool is located The mathematics heavily depend on accurate dimensions for the cutting tools otherwise you could damage your part or the machine Good software allows many different canned tool paths for efficiency tool types and achieving desired surface finish Focus is on variability in cutting tool and speeds/feeds as recommended by cutting tool suppliers for materials Common Variability Material shape/hardness Cutting tool shape/hardness Cutting tool path Lasers Hardware Minimal speed/torque requirements Good designs focus on consistent beam quality and spot focus which is relative to constant power Uses focusing lens sets spot size to control material size Software Emphasis on plug-n-play UI/UX and interoperability Dimensions are easier to achieve as less variability in the process compared to 3D printing/machining Focus is on laser power typically for material type and depth Common Variability Laser type Spot size Power supply Summary Overall there are many very different variables to consider between these technologies I only focused on variables you might see out of a hobbyist-style machine and if you've operated any of these you'll know that there are many more variables that pop up for any of these machines So do not expect such a plug-n-play solution as each machine requires quality construction of its hardware the ability to handle the variability of the process in its software and above all an operator that understands the correlation and balance of these components All of that being said there are some machines that seem to be tailored to this such as the machine by Diyouware and ZMorph No affiliation just examples However notice that they have created their own software to meet a lot of these communication requirements Update I forgot to mention the fact that a kink in creating a interchangeable machine is the control interface The controller converts the software speak into an easily parsed series of functions typically G-Code for the small computer to process its predetermined hardware processes Ie The slicer or CAM software determines that a layer of a circle be 3D printed milled routered or lasered so the controller should G02I2 which could parse to For all intents and purposes in javascript not a practical language CWCircularInterpolation(2,null,null,null,null,null and run as function CWCircularInterpolation(i,j,k,x,y,z Some code to take current position and command to create a canned circle path The point is that the software needs to handle the conditions and constraints of a different machining process and provide a well-equipped machine with the right commands There are a lot of different things to consider in attempting to combine these machining techniques into a single machine and get quality results  None if I choose the right control board The Smoothieboard supports CNC out of the box it requires initial configuration which while somewhat different is actually easier than for a 3D printer Boards supporting Grbl or Teacup will be compatible for XYZ too but may require some tinkering if you want to control the spindle You can use the same CAD software but the set of CAM tools will need to be considerably different ",
        "comments": "Can you clarify specifically what you mean by Prusa's electronics Many different control boards are used by Prusa i3 type printers.@RyanCarlyle I wasn't aware of that Maybe instead of me clarifying could the answer provide a short overview or make a suggestion of which board would be most suitable for the task?Well the really short answer to that specifically is that 3d printer electronics are designed for 3d printers and don't necessarily have the right inputs/outputs command options or motion control style for CNC machines You can certainly do it lots of people build crappy little mills that run on Marlin the most widely used 3D printer firmware but I wouldn't recommend it Likewise CNC controllers generally aren't good at 3D printing The best all-in-one controller option is probably MachineKit but it has a very steep learning curve and I would not recommend it for newbies.So there are a few possible questions I think you might ask How do I convert this multi-purpose fabricating device into a 3D printer or perhaps something more specific like How do I use a 3D printer controller like Marlin/RAMPS to do CNC milling Or How do I pick a controller for a multi-purpose fabricating device But I have to add that this is a 3D printing Q&A community and we don't really focus on all-in-one machines or CNC milling.@Ryan That's why instead of these I'm asking a top-level one that skims the surface of these One that will help me compile a checklist of things that I'll need to learn the right questions to ask and the right places to ask them I definitely don't expect a complete working solution in the current answer just an overview of the problems I'm going to face.I know any professional CAM software can produce G-code I don't know about amateur/free options but that's not a question for your site And as for slicing once you reverse the Z axis and put restrictions on travel between work points that becomes pretty analogous.Do your turning knobs that can be replaced by gears set speeds or positions?@kamuro positions The original beyond the one lathe/drill/bit motor is fully manual unmotorized The knobs turn leadscrews that move the table x,y and the head z in mill mode the blade x,y,z in lathe mode It's a modular device which you can assemble in various configurations three rail/leadscrew/knob assembly modules a motor module with replaceable heads radial vise drill/bit head grinder disc a worktable with attachable vise the unmotorized side lathe axis module plus some dumb structural modules You assemble them in any configuration building the machine you need.I've worked with CNC professionally for a time though only observed 3D printing from sidelines I think I have the CAD/CAM software side covered produce G-code that accounts for tool geometry depth variance layering and so on The hardware side would be covered too to a degree A rigid frame good steppers a drive with little play.The problem is the middle a driver both electronics and firmware/software that can interpret the G-code respect the speeds encoded and possibly allow on-the-fly adjustments and drive the 3 motors or 4 incl spindle allow easy calibration each time the tool is replaced new origin must be established and pause/abort and optionally allow rewind a couple steps back in case the tool breaks and needs to be replaced/re-sharpened.Why did you answer a question that is in my opinion too broad with an answer that is even more broad The question seems to be what do I need to do to adapt the firmware to CNC machines but your answer seems to focus on hardware.Also every decent CAM program meant to handle CNC milling will handle generation of the right G-code The question is how robust is the Prusa's controller in interpreting the G-code Obviously it won't be too happy if it's told to M04 S3500 as it can't get the extruder to spin at 3500RPM counter-clockwise But how would it handle this Ignore Abort Crash If it ignores unknown codes I'm happy with it Otherwise my work would involve finding/writing a sanitizer/simplifier for g-code to make it comprise pretty much of only G00 G01 and possibly G50.@TomvanderZanden If the first sentences would be Your goal is in my humble opinion way too broad and unfocused because the respective focuus of the machines you are trying to unify are too different I will elaborate on this by highlighting the differences in methodology of each machine would that be better I think this broad answer gives an excellent idea of what is needed to adapt 3D printer firmware to CNC machines because it shows how flexible firm and hardware need to be to be utilized for a hybrid machine.@kamuro thank you you got it I recognize that the question is too broad but it's also a grey area for this community So I wanted to encourage the questions at least,by answering this one I figured there would be a meta post about it soon I'll add a better preface to my post.",

        "answers": " Storing PLAs in plastic zip locks along with Silica Gel helps with extraction of water from PLAs If you don't have silica gel grains of rice can be other work around for serving the purpose  The easiest way to freshen up filament is hot air although there are other options There is an optimal melt processing moisture level for every plastic typically in the range of 0.1-0.2 water content by weight But the equilibrium moisture content of most plastics in humid air can be more like 1 As a consequence hot air dehydration is standard practice to prepare plastic pellets for extrusion in industry Pretty much every injection-molded and extruded plastic product in the world including 3d printer filament is made with pre-dried pellets Hot air is blown through the pellets until they are below the moisture limit Different plastics tolerate extrusion with different amounts of moisture and absorb different amounts of moisture They can also tolerate different drying temperatures So the ideal storage and drying conditions vary by material PLA absorbs relatively little moisture but in humid environments can accumulate enough water content to cause steam bubbles during extrusion In some cases steam bubbles can contribute to hot end jamming Extreme wetness has been known to cause swelling that can increase filament feed drag It's arguable whether wetness actually causes brittleness or if that is a separate aging issue People who keep their homes below 50 relative humidity usually don't have any problems Leaving PLA in a dry environment for a week or two should adequately re-dry it or it can be gently heated to about 120F 50C for a couple hours Some people dry it hotter but that risks deforming the filament ABS also doesn't absorb very much water but perhaps a little more than PLA It also experiences steam bubbles but that's typically the only issue Homes below 45 RH usually don't have problems Storing ABS with fresh silica gel for a couple weeks will dry it Or it can be oven-dried up to about 180F 80C for an couple hours HIPS can be treated the same The kind of PET used in plastic bottles is rapidly degraded into tar by hydrolysis when melted with any significant water content So PETG filaments are specially blended to absorb less water and to be less damaged by water than PET But there is still the possibility of bubbles and cloudy strands due to steam expansion at higher temperatures and there is some evidence that wet PETG produces weaker more brittle prints than dry PETG Different manufacturers blends require different conditions some people report Taulman t-glase needs oven-drying and careful storage while Esun PETG is fairly tolerant of normal home humidity levels Oven-drying at 150F 65C should work well Nylon absorbs a huge amount of water which causes it to swell considerably produce massive steam bubbles look cloudy warp more and adhere less than properly-dried nylon It's nearly unprintable when wet It should be oven-dried at around 150F 65C for 4 hours desiccant will not strip enough moisture from it In fact nylon will pull water out of used silica gel Once dry it should be stored with an aggressive desiccant either bone-dry silica or preferably calcium chloride It only takes a few hours of exposure to air for it to become excessively moist Building a sealed drybox feed system is highly recommended to avoid exposed time during and between prints Polycarbonate is similar to nylon in that is is an aggressive water-absorber It will look cloudy produce steam bubbles warp more and provide very poor layer bonding when wet It should be oven-dried at 180F 80C if on a plastic spool up to 250F 120C if dried alone for 4 hours and then stored in a drybox with aggressive desiccant just like nylon Note that some modern PC blends like Esun ePC are less prone to water absorption at the cost of some decrease in mechanical properties PVA is basically destroyed by airborne humidity since it literally dissolves in water Store in a drybox with an aggressive desiccant at all times Composite filaments should be treated like the base material Some drying and prevention options Oven The warm setting will usually work pretty well Let the oven preheat and settle out for a while and measure temperature with a good oven thermometer or thermocouple Shield the filament from direct radiant heating and hot spots with aluminum foil cookie sheets etc Electric ovens will dry faster than gas ovens because burning natural gas produces some additional moisture Do not leave the oven unattended if using temperatures above the glass point of the filament or bad things may happen Light bucket A 5-gallon plastic bucket with an incandescent lightbulb inside is a pretty effective way to gently warm low-temp filament like PLA for drying or medium-term storage Leave the lid slightly open if drying Food dehydrator Works great Set temperatures as per the oven temps above The main challenge is getting a large enough space inside for a filament spool Desiccant In order for desiccant to actively dry filament it must be significantly more attractive to water than the filament is And affinity for water is a function of how wet the material already is That means dry desiccant can easily pull some water out of very wet filament but wet desiccant can actually give water TO the filament Rechargeable indicator desiccant such as an Eva-Dry E-333 unit is ideal It's also important to have ENOUGH desiccant silica gel can only absorb 10 of its weight in water at 20 RH That means to pull 1 moisture content out of a wet 1kg spool you would need to start with at least 100g of bone-dry fresh-baked silica Used silica is basically useless it already contains too much water to pull any more from the filament But you can re-dry the silica in an oven 250F 120C for 6 hours should be safe for all types of silica gel but more aggressive drying including microwave drying is possible for some silica gels Follow the gel manufacturer instructions Rice Does not work It's basically a myth that rice has drying power A bag of rice you buy at the store is already pretty close to moisture equilibrium with the air so it has minimal capacity to pull water from filament or a soaked iPhone for that matter If you dry the rice in an oven to drive out its water first it will work to some degree but silica gel is considerably more effective Kitty litter Silica gel style kitty litter is nearly identical to desiccant silica gel Like rice it is fairly close to saturated when you open the container but can be dried in the oven to be a good cheap bulk desiccant Clay type kitty litter is not as effective Be careful of getting kitty litter dust all over your filament Dry storage A thick plastic box with an airtight seal is preferable Look for recycling code 2 HDPE or 5 PP on the box 5 gallon buckets with sealing lids also work fine Ziplocks and other thin plastic bags are better than nothing but are permeable to water yes really and can only be relied on as long as there is fresh desiccant in the bag Acrylic/plexiglas dryboxes have been sold by various people but acrylic is very permeable to water so I don't recommend that option Air conditioning Simply keeping the air in your printing environment reasonably dry will protect PLA and ABS and other low-absorption filaments It may help to buy a humidity monitor to get an understanding of your ambient humidity Now considering the original question here it's important to note that moisture content is not the only way filament can age or be damaged PLA in particular is prone to becoming brittle over time There are different theories for why this occurs One is gradual chemical aging because poly(lactic acid simply is not a very stable polymer Moisture could contribute to that aging process but true chemical aging would be irreversible even if the filament is later dried How much this occurs should depend on the specific polymer blend and storage conditions Another theory for PLA aging is that the residual filament extrusion stresses from being drawn down to the correct diameter and rapidly quenched in a water bath are slowly creeping over time Anyone who has placed a PLA part under heavy load for more than a few weeks will see PLA creep It's a rather odd polymer in that it will creep to failure and crack at very low creep elongations rather than progressively deform in a ductile manner like most creep-prone materials So if the PLA has significant stresses locked-in from the initial extrusion process which is very common it may be creeping into a more brittle arrangement of polymer molecules over time That would explain the aging effect and it would explain why drying sometimes rejuvenates the PLA heating the filament near its glass point will allow the polymer molecules to gently relax and basically anneal to a less brittle state ",

        "answers": " Yes they do reduce the speed Basically the speed at which you feed filament determines how large of a volume comes out and the distance you move the extruder means this volume gets distributed over this distance However this is not the whole story The size of your nozzle determines only two things the maximum layer height and the minimum feature size It does not affect minimum layer height and obviously doesn't affect maximum feature size although there are some practical constraints you wouldn't want to print 0.1mm layers with a 5mm nozzle The nozzle squishes the filament down as it is extruded the filament is basically forced into the gap between the nozzle and the previous layer There's no limit to how thin of a layer you can print the 60 micron figure is just something the marketing department made up you can likely print even thinner layers So long as you can position your Z-axis with sufficient accuracy which is usually no problem you can print arbitrarily thin layers On the other hand the nozzle size does determine the maximum layer height Your need the filament to be squished a bit or else it won't stick to the previous layer properly You can't print layers thicker than your nozzle size and it is generally recommended to print with a layer size that is at most 80 of your nozzle size e.g with a 0.4mm nozzle you shouldn't attempt to print layers thicker than 0.32mm but this is just a guideline Your extrusion width is the width of the line deposited by your nozzle This is generally due to the mentioned squishing a bit larger than your nozzle size With a 0.4mm nozzle you should set your extrusion width to something slightly larger like 0.5mm It is technically possible to print with an extrusion width that is the same as or even smaller than your nozzle size but this results in very weak prints as mentioned before you want the plastic to get squished slightly They claim an accuracy up to 100 micron This doesn't mean that you can print features as small as 100 micron since you can't due to the extrusion width being much larger What this means is for example that if you print a 10mm cube you should expect its real size to be between 9.9mm and 10.1mm Such a cube does not have any features that are smaller than your minimum feature size but its outer walls can be positioned with greater precision than this minimum feature size I should caution you that the 100 micron figure is up to and in practice you will have a hard time achieving this ",

        "answers": " Generally speaking voltage on stepstick output should be around 1V To imagine more or less what the current and what the voltage is you can think about it in the same way as about water The wire is more or less the same as the pipe The voltage can be imagined as sort of the height from which the water flows but the current can be imagined as an amount of water which flows To simplify things we assume that all our pipes are closed into circuit and we have pump/battery and we have a motor which is a reverted pump and finally we have our stepstick which is a tap in our model So no matter what the height voltage is we know that tap stepstick will pass some amount current of water We can drive it turning tap or turning a potentiometer on the stepstick PCB So we got it Principles deadly simplified are now clear See here for more details Getting back to your question You have to know what is your stepstick reference voltage To make sure about that you have to check out resistor(s next to main black element on stepstick board There should be R100 or R200 which are very common Now you should read data from motor label to know what is proper current for your motor and calculate voltage motor_current 8 resistance_of_resistor So now you know what is proper voltage for your motor and stepstick You measure voltage between potentiometer and GND see on the picture If you set and connect everything and start printouts you should check motor temperature Use your finger If you can touch motor and hold your finger not more than half a second then probably the voltage set on potentiometer is too high motor can reach 80 Celsius and it's fine but more will shorten its life span and you should reduce it a bit reduce by 5/100 V If you notice that motor growls or barks then your voltage is probably too low and you can increase it by 5/100V Too high current will also reduce longevity of stepstick so cool them out with fan Please be noticed Z-axis motors will usually be not too hot as they work less than X and Y but as they are both connected to one stepstick so they need more current set higher voltage there Here is a reprap.org site to get basic knowledge about stepsticks  I want to add some points and clarifications to the answer that darthpixel already has given Most information you need is in there I want to give some more practical advice since that is what I understand you're question is asking for I'll start with some points on the more theoretical side though notice that the Vref is not a voltage that is passed on to your motor The described pipe analogy is very good but the Vref is outside of this analogy The reference voltage Vref is only used to set the current limit This seems confusing but has electronic reasons One can understand the major side benefit easily Voltages are very easy to measure externally because you connect your voltmeter in parallel If you wouldd want to measure the current you would need to get your ammeter in series with the circuit The stepsticks work by supplying the needed current for movement of the motor current because it works by creating magnetic fields the voltage the stepstick supplies is just supplied as high as needed to feed the desired current through your motor determined by its resistivity/impedance This just as an add-on Now to the practical side and the application of darthpixel's answer and the above You want to measure the reference voltage to limit the current that produces the torque but also heats up the motor let darthpixel's advice be your guide if you can't touch it because it is too hot then there is too much current i.e Vref is too high To do so Set your multimeter to volts range can be autorange or something bigger than 2V Connect one lead of your multimeter to the ground of your Prusa i3 controller board's power input I use the screw that fastens the ground input of the RAMPS The other lead goes directly to the center of the trimpot on the Stepstick I took the best of my paint skills to create an image showing the process Note the value you read 12V power has to be on Use an insulated screwdriver and turn the trimpot slightly Get a new reading by repeating the measurement process Repeat the whole process until you get the desired Vref Warning While I've had no problems turning the trimpot while everything was switched on with my DRV8825 drivers you should switch the power supply off when doing so The described process allows only for a stepwise and rather slow setting of the Vref but this is the easiest way I've found I have read of people that use a crocodile clamp to attach the multimeter to the screwdriver for a readout while turning If you don't have any idea whether you need more or less current on the motor at the moment check your resistors on the board and calculate the Vref you should need see darthpixel's answer for the formula I would however just do what darthpixel already suggested figure out the trimpot position by ears and touch klicking motor go to higher Vref Can't touch the motor for more than some seconds go to lower Vref It might be a lengthy process but in the end you'd need to do it anyway to get the best out of the printer ",

        "answers": " Mains voltage is the alternating current provided by your wall outlets eg 120v in USA In order to use a mains voltage heatbed in a 3d printer you will need to wire up your controller to switch an AC SSR That way your low-voltage-DC RAMPS board can control AC current If you plug a heatbed directly into a power supply it will never stop heating and may burn itself up or even cause a fire Don't do that Because mains voltage has enough voltage to kill you it should only be used for STATIONARY components such as the PSU supply wiring and Delta heatbeds With moving beds particularly Mendel/i3 style Y-beds wire fatigue and rubbing can expose the electrical conductors and create a serious safety hazard 200x200mm is a very reasonable size for a DC bed heater so there's really no good reason to use an AC heater here It's more complex and less safe I recommend getting a different heater  edit I just noticed you've mentioned mains voltage DON'T DO THAT If there is 12V on your heatbed and your power supply gives 12&nbsp;V then you can do it but there will be no control over your heating procedure How does it work RAMPS is connected to Arduino and then through Arduino to your computer So applications can say to Arduino hey heat it up up to 70\u00b0C So Arduino sends this command to RAMPS and RAMPS is switching on heating meantime it measures temperature and sends this measurement to Arduino so it knows if your heatbed is already at 70\u00b0C or not Having that knowledge Arduino can decide to still heat it up or rather switch the power of the heatbed off If you connect your heatbed directly to your power supply then all of the above controlling sequence will not take place Imagine to connect your lightbulb directly to the wall plug You can do it but then you will not have any chance to switch it on or off Right So in my opinion don't do that don't connect your heatbed directly to your power supply  The heater pad described in your link is designed for 12 VDC or 24 VDC Therefore the term Mains Voltage in the description is misleading and probably wrong Read the voltage and power requirements again and it appears that the heater pad can be connected directly to the RAMPS 1.4 without an external relay or SSR ",
        "comments": "What is an AC SSR?basically solid state relay element which uses low voltage to switch on/off high voltage@Ryan Carlyle how was it possible to double post D\"How do I wire an AC SSR with RAMPS would be an excellent thing to ask in another question.I wouldn't say a mains voltage bed is less safe than a low-voltage DC one While AC has the potential to kill you the current needed for a DC bed is much higher Therefore you need thicker conductors which are less flexible and more likely to break due to motion and higher rated terminals Considering the majority of printer fires are caused by the high current of a DC bed melting connectors there's a good case to be made for a mains-power bed especially considering that earthing mitigates the risk of wiring getting exposed With RE complexity a DC heater requires a PSU AC does not.Note that if you plug a mains heated bed directly into your 12/24)V power supply it will barely heat up at all because its resistance is far too high I don't think the don't do that in all caps is warranted since it suggests there is some kind of danger.@TomvanderZanden I did think the same way at the beginning till I realised he mentioned mains voltage which suggests using 120/250V but not 12/24V@TomvanderZanden In terms of current and under-rated wiring/connectors yes I agree absolutely I'm a strong proponent of 24v systems over 12v for that reason But anything over 40V puts the equipment in a different class as far as regulatory requirements and safety certifications simply because it has the ability to kill someone almost instantly on contact Having all the mains-voltage AC stop at the UL/CE certified PSU is a major testing time+cost advantage for manufacturers So you're very unlikely to see AC beds on anything but large hobby builds And those cheap AC SSRs often fail-on!The pad in question actually has three wires coming off of it two red ones and one black one And it reads 12V on it.That is correct The reason for three wires is so that you can hook it up to either a 12 VDC supply or to a 24 VDC supply The hookup will be slightly different depending on the supply voltage you use I cannot tell you exactly which connections to make but my guess is for 12 VDC connect the red wires together and to one side of the power and connect the black wire to the other side of the power Even though the links says you can go directly to the power supply I still recommend you go through the controller The description on that link is badly written.As typhonic points out in his answer https 3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/1536/what-does-uses-mains-voltage-mean-on-this-200200mm-square-silicone-heater-pad#answer-1548 the product description is very confusing suggesting that 12/24VDC be used and then that 120/240 VAC can be used I have written to RobotDigg for clarification",

        "answers": " A link to the bed you have/are buying would be very helpful AC heated beds exist but are fairly uncommon As one of the answers in the question you linked notes the heat bed is probably not actually intended to use the 110 VAC/220 VAC directly from the wall and instead needs either 12 VDC or 24 VDC If the current it needs is less than 11 A then it can be connected directly to port D8 on the RAMPS 1.4 where it will take power from a suitably powerful 12/24 VDC supply connected to the 11 A input on the board A more powerful heater will need an external relay/MOSFET/etc to control If you do in fact have an AC bed you can connect a SSR like this to either D8 or D9 on the RAMPS D10 could be used but it would need a supply connected to the 11 A input making sure the polarity is correct as long as your RAMPS DC supply voltage is within the input range of the SSR The linked one is 3\u201332 VDC so almost any supply voltage compatible with the RAMPS will work The AC outputs of the SSR should be connected in series between one side of the bed and the AC hot wire with the AC neutral wire connected to the other side of the bed so most of the circuit isn't carrying high voltage when off This video has some useful hints However while an AC bed can get you faster heating will let you use thinner wires and avoids the need for having a big DC power supply I would recommend against using a mains voltage bed if you don't know what you're doing\u2014a great deal more care must be taken and there is a serious possibility of injury  If you take a kettle lead with a wall plug and cut off the other end it will expose 3 wires earth live and neutral These are color coded depending on your country usually earth is green possibly with yellow stripes neutral is blue black grey or white and live is brown red or black The SSR should have 4 terminals 2 terminals for the switched load which are interchangeable and 2 terminals that connect to your electronics which should be marked negative and positive These terminals should connect to the negative/positive heated bed output of your electronics The terminals of the SSR should be clearly marked and you can verify which terminal is what from the SSR's datasheet Typically your heated bed will have two wires for power which are interchangeable One of the wires should be connected to neutral The other wire should go to one of the load terminals of the SSR while the other load terminal of the SSR should connect to the live wire It is also acceptable to do it the other way around neutral to the SSR and live directly to the bed but this is slightly less neat Finally and this step is extremely important the earth wire of the plug has a protective function should something fail metal parts of your printer may become electrified and shock you when you touch them To prevent it you should electrically connect exposed metal parts of your printer such as the frame heated bed plate power supply case etc to earth This provides a path for the current to flow and trip the protective RCD breaker should something go wrong I would further recommend that you protect your heated bed particularly if it is a high power model with a bimetallic thermal switch These are available in a variety of ratings and will switch the power to your heated bed off when it goes over a certain temperature This switch should be wired between the relay and the heated bed and be mounted on the heated bed so it makes good thermal contact If you plan to print with the heated bed at 110C you might get a 120C or 130C thermal switch As mains voltage can be deadly you should take appropriate precautions never work on the printer while it is plugged in cover any connections in particular make sure you buy or print a cover for the SSR's terminals and wrap solder joints in heat shrink or electrical tape and always treat wires coming out of the SSR as live even if it is switched off some current can still flow ",

        "comments": "I've always found it odd that 3D printers have basically the reverse homing sequence from conventional cnc machines Most industrial mills lasers and routers homing order is Z Y then X This is to reduce the chances of crashing into any fixtures mounted on the work table.The answer to this question is completely dependent on the firmware your printer is running and the configuration of said firmware the homing order in Marlin is configurable you have a variety of options such as home Z first or home X and Y simultaneously 3d printers generally have the z endstop at the bottom rather than the top for better or worse So homing z would make it crash into anything under it Many people me included put the z endstop on top because that just makes more sense.I don't see how this is is an answer to the question The question asks how the homing works in term of the algorithm that is used but your answer is just some remark about how people crash their hotend into the bed because of bad endstop config.Hi Tom Sorry you find it confusing I explain how end stops work and how the firmware electronics see and process the states Which does answer the question I think you got lost with the extra information about why the heads would crash That was to express how the different firmwares handle and fail to handle carriage position Let me know if you have other questions Happy printing!",

        "answers": " There are no settings that you should need to change Rather it seems like you are suffering from another issue that is not directly related to layer height It is possible that your hotend's heat sink is not being cooled enough causing heat to migrate up and soften plastic in the heat sink ultimately jamming it Depending on your hotend's make the heat sink should be cooled by a fan that is always on Normally the plastic being fed into the hotend provides some cooling but printing at a thinner layer height decreases this effect because less plastic is fed into the hotend per time unit  I agree with Tom's answer it seems that temperature slowly makes it's way up your heat sink and softens the plastic which causes the jam Even though you should first check your hardware to make sure that hotend cooling is installed correctly to directly address your original question as to what setting needs to be changed I would suggest lowering your printing temperature When printing finer layers the plastic moves slower in the hotend spending more time in the heater block possibly making your current temperature setting too high for this resolution  Yes That is what happens There is a reason that most people cannot break the 1mm barrier You have several things happening First if you are using a bowden Good luck The bowden treats plastic a lot like a spring Just wont be able to generate a consistent pressure The direct gear will have the same issue You are trying to spit out 0.1mm on a 0.5mm nozzle Factor in some simple drooling and your dot of plastic is missing You wouldn't think it matters but when we are using such tiny amounts of plastic and consistently throughout the print it makes for a really bad result Then you have more issues This is why you jam You now have a lot of plastic sitting not being expelled When you go from 0.2mm to 0.1mm you now take twice the time Considering the printer was made to print at a 0.7 to 0.2 range more or less We are talking about a fair time for this plastic to sit molten waiting to come out Some have mentioned the heat crawl but not exactly what happens or a solution Now you do a retraction and you just retracted molten plastic Which gets jammed Or your plastic cooks carbonizes faster and clogs your hotend Sad times What you can do is turn off retraction and then increase your flow extrusion multiplier to account for the extra drooling Part will have a lot of stringing but a quick burst from a lighter fixes most of that You can get better results with a hotend that has a fan and heat sink break I like the e3d hot ends That will stop the heat crawl I will note that Makergear once sent me an experimental 0.1mm nozzle It could not build enough pressure to expel the plastic I got one tiny bunny half melted before it clogged from aforementioned carbonization Sounds like to me you really just need a form 1 or you are a tinkerer like me Making the printer go twice the speed is much more fun than high quality ",

        "body": " Background I just successfully installed a RepRapDiscount Full Graphic Display on my Prusa i3 and in doing so I've upgraded all of the firmware to the latest version of Marlin 1.1.0-RC7 With my previous version of Marlin 1.0.2-1 everything was working perfectly I've transferred every parameter over from my older version to my newer one There were some aspects of code that were written differently but essentially everything works except the Z-Axis Problem The one issue that I seem to be having is with any kind of movement with the Z-Axis When it moves whether from the LCD or Repetier it appears to accelerate as it is supposed to but then gets stuck/skips a bunch of steps and then decelerates slowly as it's supposed to Regardless of the distance I instruct it to move it will accelerate normally for the same amount of time/distance/steps go into this unholy mode for a period of time/distance/steps relative to what it was instructed and then smoothly decelerates for the exact same amount of time every time For example if it is supposed to move 10000 steps it will move 100 steps smoothly then skip for 9800 steps and finish with another 100 steps smoothly If for example it needs to move 5000 steps it will also move 100 steps smoothly then skip for 4800 steps and finish smoothly the last 100 steps Keep in mind these numbers are completely drawn from space they are not accurate by any stretch of the imagination I'm just trying to paint as clear of a picture as possible Troubleshooting At first I checked to make sure everything is mechanically sound The nuts move freely up and down the 5mm threaded rod There are no points along the entire length of the rod that the nuts don't move very freely The stainless steel rods are well aligned and the entire Z/X-Axis carriage moves very freely along the vertical rails The bearings appear to be fine I then wanted to narrow it down to being the firmware and not electrical For the record maybe I'm missing something obvious so please let me know I measured the voltage on my A4988 stepper drivers on the RAMPS 1.4 board sitting on the Arduino Mega2560 R3 and it is reading 350mV Even if I adjust the potentiometer to 550mV I still get the same issue The jumpers underneath seem to be snugly in place and all the pins on the A4988 appear to be fine as well The one thing I haven't checked in the section logically analyzing is the wires going from the board to the motors themselves but based on the following I don't believe that is the issue Although I have been wrong before Moving onto the firmware I've played around with the default settings section in Configuration.h with no avail Regardless of how low or high I go with any of the max acceleration settings I cannot seem to fix the

        "answers": " Googling what temperature for different filaments gives a few good links but the top link looks golden https filaments.ca/pages/temperature-guide They have temperature guides for both extrusion temperatures and heated bed as well as suggestions for better adhesion I'm not that experienced but their information is similar to information I've seen elsewhere Their suggestion for PLA is 215-235 degrees Celsius and a bed temperature of 60 to 80 degrees That sounds a bit hot to me but every brand and type of filament will perform best at different temperatures I've had problem getting nice bridges at 210 degrees but had excellent results at 190 For ABS they say 230 to 240 degrees with the bed at 80 to 100 Use these values as a starting point when they fail you make an educated guess about what went wrong and adjust one parameter at a time til it works for you Find a calibration object you like and trim the temperatures so it prints the best your printer can At this point in the technology experimentation is a large part of making things work One thing that's important to remember is that the temperature that you set your bed to and the temperature that your bed gets to is not the same thing Depending on the construction assembly and quality of your heater the actual temperature can differ anything from almost nothing to twenty degrees or more  First you say 90c which means you are talking about ABS likely I state this as some PLA printers do not even use heated beds and instead use elaborate rafts only Makerbot Now that I have gotten that out of the way I wanted to point out to you that it really isn't using that much power 110 watts based off this fellow http reprage.com/post/39698552378/how-much-power-does-a-3d-printer-use 8 hours 0.11 USD http energy.gov/energysaver/estimating-appliance-and-home-electronic-energy-use I am sure this number is not 100 spot on That said having had used a power monitor when I first started out I can confirm getting very cheap results Actually I calculated the costs of powering my 1 meter by 1 meter silicon heater It was not that much This will not apply to every printer Some are built better than others Last for Min Temp You will pick the temp that works for the specific plastic Every plastic is different Materials with high pigments usually need higher temps for extrusions That said generally PLA is 60 ABS is 90-100 When it is wrong you will see more almost always see some heat warping I also want to mention that heat chambers give the best result and would not require you to use the bed as much You don't see these on printers for two reasons Heaters can catch fire and because of patents blocking people from selling nothing stopping you though Look into just using a Box without an active heater if it is still a concern  Heatbeds have two purposes Increase surface energy of the print bed to improve bonding strength of the first layer particularly important when using surfaces like PEI or Kapton Keep the bottom few millimeters of the print hot enough to provide a warp-free foundation for the rest of the print The bit about surface energy is straightforward Most materials are stickier when hot than cold In comparison pure mechanical-bonding bed surfaces like fibrous painter's tape and perfboard don't particularly benefit from bed heat Warping is a bit more complicated The basic cause of warping is when the previous layer is allowed to cool and thermally contract before the next layer is deposited When you stick hot expanded material on top of cold contracted material large shear stresses are generated when the fresh material cools and contracts Those inter-layer shear stresses then accumulate over many layers into large-scale bending stresses that try to lift the edges of the print off the bed So to prevent warping we should minimize the amount that the previous layer is allowed to cool before the next layer goes down But we DO need it to cool solid so the print doesn't sag in a mushy mess This is a balancing act cooling the plastic solid without over-cooling it The optimal temperature for the print is right around the glass point of the plastic this is the temperature at which the plastic becomes fully solid and thermal contraction stresses start to accumulate The extruder pumps more heat into the print as it deposits molten plastic and radiates a little bit of heat So we want to set the heatbed temp a little bit below the glass point to ensure the print is able to cool solid Now this gets a bit difficult because everyone's print bed temperature sensor is different What matters is bed surface temp Many people have to set their bed temp quite a bit higher than the actual surface temp It's just something you have to calibrate via print results The exact filament glass point Tg also depends on the blend ABS Tg is around 105C optimal bed temp 95C in a warm low-airflow environment PLA Tg is around 55C optimal bed temp is 55C in a cool high-airflow environment because PLA holds heat and is slow to cool compared to other filaments PETG Tg is around 70C optimal bed temp is 60-70C with mild airflow Nylon doesn't really work with these rules because it's semi-crystalline meaning it freezes far above its Tg and thus starts accumulating warping stress at fairly high temps advice varies wildly from printing cold to 120C bed PC Tg is around 150C optimal bed temp is 130C There are other schools of thought for example printing the first layer onto a surface much hotter than Tg for good adhesion and then dropping the bed temp to a value somewhat below Tg to allow the print to solidify That works fine too But with all that said it's important to understand that the heatbed only keeps the bottom of the print warm A centimeter up from the build plate the print is typically much closer to ambient temp than it is to the bed temp Heated build chambers are thus much more effective for large prints But heatbeds are still quite effective because they allow building a strong warp-free foundation that resists warping stresses induced by the cooler zones higher up in the print ",

to learn Blender you are certain to discover that it will do as you require and much much more Your referenced model could be created using engineering-type design software such as Fusion 360 or SolidWorks or many of the free packages but the free-form aspect is more suited to the flexibility of Blender Even though Blender is not an engineering-type program it has internal support for precise modeling Should you learn to use those features you get the best of both types of software If you construct your model in the software in segments/pieces as you suggest your result will have greater flexibility at the printing stage specifically with respect to color and filament choices Instead of wood-colored sides you can use wood-simulated PLA filament Depending on the printer at the library you could also use filamet a filament containing 88 percent metal for the hoops I use Blender for some aspects of modeling often importing the STL into Meshmixer to address things I've not yet learned in Blender I hope your reference to 5 liter is the original size and that your model will be a miniature of it A 3d printer with 5 liter capacity would be a wonderful asset at the public library  We get this question a lot in the facebook groups I manage The usual answers do not include blender as it has a stupid hard learning curve That is overkill for what you are looking to do Look into 123d from autodesk Free if you do not make money I find this one to be the easiest http www.123dapp.com/design Also there is Google sketchup with SLT out plugin I find this one is pretty sub par due to the fact it does not create printable models well ie missing triangles so it wont create solids hard to fix http www.sketchup.com I think this one pops up I haven't used it and I think it costs but worth a mention https www.rhino3d.com  To the people saying 123design I can only say I have been a blender user way before 3D printing was a thing and just cant get around learning 123design It just feels so limited as it only have a few tools Yes blender might have a hard learning curve but it does pay off in the future as you wont be limited to 3D printing models and its crucial to make more complex models  I think Autodesk Meshmixer is the best as you can easily make parts with boolean operations if you're more of a cubic thinking guy or drag-and-sculpt if you're more of a freeform guy And thoses videos are old but still working If you want to get better reflexes in CAD engineering I think Solidworks is the best but really expensive if you aren't an enterprise if you want to get better knowledge in 3D design and animations maybe blender is good but surely not for CAD people neither for beginners in 3D even if it's well-documented  I would highly recommend you checkout Onshape for your design https www.onshape.com It is the easiest to use full featured free 3D CAD program It is made and in active development by the creators of Solidworks the most widely used CAD program out there for good reason And it runs in the cloud so you don't need a high powered PC with an amazing graphics card just a decent internet connection Onshape looks like it's going to be the future of mechanical CAD whereas other programs like 123d and Sketchup are simply lightweight versions of real CAD Unless you want to get highly involved in organic complex shapes I would avoid Blender you will spend so much time learning it you could have whittled your barrel from a log instead  I recently purchased a 3d printer and have found that freecad suited me really well http www.freecadweb.org and its open source I believe its very similar to onshape in its a parametric modeller but runs locally rather that online Using the Parts view i have made most of my models using basic shapes and boolen subtractions  I'm no expert but have done some research on this question and it seems to me that Fusion 360 is currently your best bet It's designed to do exactly what you're planning from start to finish Design Sculpting and precision modeling Test fitting/animation analysis and Fabricate CAM and 3D printing all wrapped into one program that has a logical workflow and is WAY easier to learn than Blender It's free for hobbyists and startups making less than 100K/yr There are a bunch of free tutorials online professionally produced by Autodesk By the time you get through those you should be able to complete your project Edit I don't know anything about onshape.com Like I said I'm no expert  You can check out Tinkercad It is an easy to use online editor Even though it is not as powerful as Blender or Rhino3d for easy 3d models it is more than sufficient  If you have any programming background at all consider OpenScad It is a functional type of programming language that lets you do a lot of things quite easily without art skills OpenScad skills are useful for building customizable things on Thingiverse Here is a place to start ",

        "answers": " I just started with google and phrase 3d printing color mixing and on the first place in fact first two were valueless adverts I got this intructables How it works It uses magenta cyan yellow filaments and mixes it while printing with Diamond hotent It definitely does what you are asking for and it's exactly the same idea you come up with  As darth_pixel points out people have had limited success with feeding multiple colors into a diamond hotend and mixing them but I would argue this is not truly what you're looking for The problem is that when feeding multiple filaments into a diamond-style hotend the colors do not naturally mix completely if you look at an object printed this way the color changes with the angle you view it from This would not be fundamentally impossible to overcome you could make the melt zone longer and possibly introduce something to promote mixing like a spiral path for the molten plastic However this would greatly increase the force required to extrude and make retraction near impossible Both of these issues would reduce print quality The results would also not be very good as you'd need a long purge between colors limiting the number of distinct colors you can use in a single model while keeping the print time acceptable Moreover given how limited the resolution of FDM is you could not make very detailed graphics either Over all you're much better served with painting or assembling parts printed in different colors Given the limited potential for color printing in FDM and the mentioned obstacles to building a color mixing hotend I think it is natural nobody has built one but that doesn't mean it is fundamentally impossible There have been some attempts many on Kickstarter but none have been truly successful  Branching off of TomvanderZanden's answer this process cannot easily be done with an extruder alone To properly color polymers a pigment must be added during the initial treatment process otherwise applied during any heat treatment These pigments do not necessarily allow a simple red blue purple process to change the color for many reasons including Polymer Transparency Polymer Refractive Index Kinda goes with Transparency but how light interacts with the surface of the material might set how people perceive the color Polymer Quality how virgin it is Non-virgin material may mean that impurities absorb the pigments easier or refract light differently giving a different color Pigment Quality If a cheaper pigment is used it may not bind as well with the polymer etc The above variables may hinder the desired color in even a single batch of plastic let alone trying to mix two together Also consider that the pigments in each filament spool will be deluded as it has already bonded to the current filament Review a phase diagram for an optimal temperature and time to introduce pigments The best case would be to create your own masterbatch and somehow re-color the filament as you would in a normal manufacturing process  The three in one print head is the closest to your concept of gradient printing and does some nice transitions But does not meet your color mixing Which I assume your looking for there is something like blue and yellow making green and by varying those percent getting shades of green The three in one head does get close to a dot by dot transition I have since I first seen the crowd funding request for the Palette been dwelling on this same concept true color printing in 3D like a laser printer prints paper The Palette Palette web site is moving closer to color mixing or fast transitions for multiple colors and again can make flowing color changes but still not a true mixer But is is still color striping I want one for simple sake of switching color spools with out pulling off and re-feeding filament And for my Rostock allowing two to four color switching with a single head For many months I have pondered taking their unit for its software ability to pre-switch colors and feed it with a three color head My plan that I have been mulling for months now is cross mixing of their color switcher with five into one extruder with not a print nozzle but a 1.75 or 3mm filament production nozzle to produce a software timed output based on desired print color effect Then feeding that to your single nozzle printer would make a true multi-color mixer As I was thinking on assembling myself this and put it out there for use but first I hate doing a lot of programing second I have health issues slowing me down third is way to many project So here is a concept Five extruders CYM-BW cyan yellow magenta black white These feed a forming nozzle 1.75mm out into a pfte tube going to printer extruder The forming nozzle is several centimeters long and has it own secondary heater The interior is milled with a 5 in to a swirl wall like a mixing nozzle on epoxy Color filament feeding three of the nozzles are your primary colors set in the center of the color range PrintCOLOR(C Y M command set basically like other color sets 0-255 range Difference being is 0 is white filament 254 is black filament 255 is no filament 127 is pure color With 1-126 gradient mix of white and color 128-253 gradient mix of black and color Feed by extruders into mixer must total extruder speed of printer which is where need for PrintCOLOR(C Y M programming is required For instance making green out of C and Y PrintCOLOR(127 127 0 would need half speed blue and half speed yellow So who knows maybe some one like the makers of Palette or some crowd funder can run with this I think it is fully do able Three color diamond head can not produce WHITE by mixing To print white requires dropping one color to substituting in the white And it requires major modification to many printers to add The CYM filament picked for use on a diamond head alone sets the maximum darkness allowed Having ability to mix white and black to CYM solves this issue 5 color CYM-WB is minimum to get a true mix  A Kickstarter campaign just finished for a full color 3D FDM printer the RoVa4D Full Color Blender 3D Printer It used CYMK printing and includes black and white filament for 5 color filament feeds plus additional feeds for flexible and support filaments They raised 216K against a target of 25K The company that is doing this has other printers in production I believe This one adds the color capability It's planned for 12\"x12\"x18 print volume I am not associated with the project ",
        "comments": "Probably better in theory to build your own filament production tool similar to those which recycle plastic crud into new filament and use that to generate each color you want Then for a multicolor object swap filaments at appropriate levels.Another problem is that it takes too long to switch from one color to another since the old color has to be purged A comment on the guy's YouTube video says it takes 100mm to fully switch colors That would add up to quite a bit of waste.Any other day this would get the selected answer as it does what I wanted Though with so many good answers I will have to go with the direct question of what is stopping us That said thanks for the link I don't know why that did not appear in my googling.Three color diamond head can not produce WHITE by mixing To print white requires dropping one color to substituting in the white And it requires major modification to many printers to add The CYM filament picked for use on a diamond head alone sets the maximum darkness allowed Having ability to mix white and black to CYM solves this issue 5 color CYM-WB is minimum to get a true mix.So it comes out like toothpaste?Maybe I missed the point of the question but you can totally do color mixing with a diamond hotend to produce a range of colors right now I think they make a 3 way one that allows Cyan Magenta and Yellow like a traditional desktop printer http www.reprap.org/wiki/Repetier_Color_MixingThough if you just want to do crazy gradients you can just buy filament that gradually cycles colors every so often it produces neat results https www.amazon.com/STAR-Alchement-Gradient-Filament-filament/dp/B01CNFUH6Q/Perhaps the actual answer is nothing is stopping you This is exactly what the diamond hot end is for Here's the reprap wiki guide for doing CMY color mixing with Repetier http www.reprap.org/wiki/Repetier_Color_MixingThere's certainly a lag between color changes but from what I've seen the color mixing does happen correctly As for the purging that seems like it can be accounted for calibrated to the point where the slicer can just use partially changed colors for the infill I would say this could be expanded on That said this is the best solution at this point.",

        "comments": "The idea that a microwave only heats up water is completely wrong Many more materials can be heated by microwaves.Of course you are right But microwave is generally designed oscilation selected to excite water particles primarily Many metals get heated up by MW of more prcisely by eddy currents But in terms of PLA and his 3 arm star it's not applicable here is a part of the article you linked and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion thus dispersing energy My understanding of microwave oven is precisely as this citation and my answer is based on this understanding Frequecy means oscillation for me and not only for me wiki:frequency-This article is about the rates of waves oscillations and vibrations I have a feeling you are trying to over-generalize questions and then answers no offenceHeat IS rotation/oscillation so obviously that will be involved at some point However you are making the claim that microwaves are designed to heat up water and only heat up water and therefore items not containing water do not heat up This is not true It could very well be or not that PLA has dipoles as well The exact mechanic by which the heating happens is secondary to this if you continue reading beyond the quoted portion you'll notice that they mention that heating through resonance is a common misconception which I thought your argument about oscillation was referring to  I've read whole article in EN and in my native lang again to not argue without arguments As I said you are right but it's not really applicable to his question.This raises the question of what the original part was made of and whether or not that material be used in a 3D printer.ABS filament tends to absorb water over time so I would think and ABS part wouldn't hold up.I would AVOID plastics and anything involving heat and foods A lot of plastics are food safe but their additives are not Or they are cut with cheaper plastics that are not.@JohnSensebe I'm not convinced that water is an issue The water will only make up a tiny percentage of the total mass so even if it heats up the plastic itself won't heat up much and regular heating through the microwave may drive off the water.ABS does not cause any issues when heated?You should elaborate a bit more on this Why is it okay to use PLA and why is using ABS presumably better?1 I doubt it gets that hot in a microwave Do you have anything to back this up The plastic part is sandwiched between the metal case and glass plate both of which are heat sinks and stay quite cool to the touch in my microwave anyways 2 I'm pretty sure PLA is not inherently food-unsafe but in any case in his application this is not a problem because the plastic isn't anywhere near the food There are lots of commercial uses of PLA in food applications.Just because someone uploaded something to Thingiverse doesn't make it safe If you were to attempt this though it'd probably be safest to use uncolored ABS because its glass point is higher than PLA and you never know what's in the colors.@TomvanderZanden I agree Unless heating up PLA produces some off-gasses I don't see any reason not to try it out Worst case scenario the structure will bend and not function which really isn't that big of a deal.This seems a very generic answer about food safety of plastics while the question is about using the plastic in an application where it won't be in contact with food at all and the main concern is how it would hold up to microwaves You could have skipped the entire part about why PLA might not be food safe which is irrelevant completely and then the answer boils down to Yes you can do this completely ignoring whether microwaves might affect PLA.As the application of the material is in an environment in which food is prepared some of the context of why PLA and even food grade(FDA approved PLA may not be food safe is completely relevant.You are making an assumption that the piece won't be in contact with food at all This is a microwave Boil-overs et al happen Exposure to organic compounds/food etc is almost inevietable Therefore some comments on prep(sealing the PLA piece and clean-up(warm soapy water also were justified I did not comment with specifics as to Food safe PLA reactions with microwaves as that would depend on which product the user elected to go with Such information would normally be contained in the MSDS sheets of said product(s and would be available pre and post purchase.You think people should look up the most essential piece of information asked for in this question in MSDS's and you do not even mention that this could be an issue even though you could very well make some general statement as to the microwave compatibility of PLA plastic in general I find that very strange since food safety is secondary to this question and there are many good questions and answers about food safety already and product specific as well so for food safety your same line of reasoning says that it should be looked up in the product datasheets If something in your microwave boils over I don't think any reasonable person would try to eat the portion of the food that boiled over and came into contact with the plastic In this application it will never happen that something comes into contact with the plastic and subsequently goes into someone's mouth I don't see how bacterial growth or trace amounts of lead could be a problem in that case.@TomvanderZanden the way I see it especially with cheap Asian filament that contains god knows what additives unless the manufacturer specifically specified the filament does not produce poisonous gas when heated it should not be used in a Microwave or anywhere else there's a combination of heat and food)Material traits I did reference reviewing the MSDS sheets in my original post As each product will have varying physical and chemical characteristics mentioning such in detail would also go well beyond the scope of the original query Food Safety So it is logical to have a component which is if unprepared prone to bacterialogical growth in a food preparation device Such is not logical Equally there are more vehicles for cross contamination than simply oral However the productivity of the exchange is clearly limited at this point Best of luck in your endeavours.",

        "answers": " Your best option may be to seek out a silicone rubber heating mat using those terms for your web search A quick search on my part shows many resources some of which are known to the 3d printing manufacturing world while others are equally suited for that purpose Don't bond the heater to the glass You'll need to replace it when it breaks Consider to use borosilicate glass for better heat tolerance and smaller chance of breakage A quick search for such a large size pane comes up empty invalidating that suggestion I've read of some people using water bed heaters for large area coverage but they may heat the area unevenly It could be to your advantage to use multiple heater panels with temperature controls for each one This would provide more uniform heating although more complex temperature management I would post links but there are so many from which to choose  Maybe you can stick a nichrome wire under the glass using a heat resistant tape You'll have to make the appropriate calcs or just trial/error to achieve the desired temperature at a consistent timing  It will be very difficult to heat such a large bed simply because of the enormous power required Thomas Sanladerer recommends at least 0.6W/cm2 but notes 0.4W/cm2 also works but takes forever to reach the target temperature For a 30\"x30 bed 0.6W/cm2 would come out to 3.5kW At 110V that would require 32A and at 220V 16A These are extremely large currents perhaps more than you can draw from a single circuit both in the EU and US sockets tend to be fused at around 15-20A the standard EU Schuko plug itself is only rated for 16A You will be forced to go with a lower amperage for 0.5W/cm2 you only need 27A@110V or 14A@220V 0.4W/cm2 is 21A and 11A respectively As such if you are in the US then it will be impossible to heat such a bed from a standard wall outlet In the EU it might just about be possible but make sure that the wiring in your house is in good state and capable to carry the current required and note that running electrical equipment at its maximum rating for an extended period of time is never a good idea If you are in the US you should definitely look into getting 3-phase power installed If you are in the EU you might also consider this as an option It is able to deliver more power but you'd need a special type of heater There are some suppliers that make custom silicone heater mats If you can get one in this size that would be a good option though it would be considerably more expensive than your 5 piece of glass In any case you should not attempt a DIY solution because this is extremely dangerous The currents you are dealing with should not be underestimated People have already set their printers on fire due to using high currents at 12/24V you do not want to make a similar mistake using even higher currents at 110V  As Tom pointed out heating that much area is a pretty big deal I would just add You can't draw anywhere near that much power from the normal heatbed output on a PC board like RAMPs You could however use the normal output to control a big relay semiconductor or not that also lets you keep the high-power wiring away from the rest You'll want multiple temperature sensors and heat zones for at least 2 reasons First variation may be high over such an area and second you can save a lot of power by only powering up the portions you're going to use However just like with home heating having multiple zones makes things much more complicated The software for managing heatbed temperature isn't likely to support multiple heaters especially since most cards don't have enough outputs to make use of it I've done a bit with this since my printer is about 4x as long as normal but not 4x as wide too like yours So far I just use one standard PC-board heatbed and if I have to print something longer than that I do without the heatbed entirely mine is easy to take in and out Present plan is to get a few more of the same PC-board heaters and have an entirely separate box with temperature dials to control each one But that still means the printer software won't be in control So I couldn't for example have a different temp for the first few layers or have the print stop if the heatbed gets out of range To put the printer back in charge I'd have to do something like calculate the average or maximum temperature of the zones and create a signal that looks like what a thermistor or thermocouple would generate to send to the printer software The software would then turn the heat on or off as usual but that output would go to the control box which would decide what specifically to do about it For example even when the printer says to turn off the heat control might keep the cooler zones on until they catch up

        "answers": " I have only experienced PLA super sticking if the print bed is allowed to cool too much I would suggest running a mild preheat to your bed when you find a print has stuck and the bed is cool What you set the temp to for the preheat would depend on the filament in question but start low and work up and you may find a sweet spot/release point for your particular PLA I have never encountered PLA super sticking printed with rafts on regardless of printbed temperature Rafts will give you a sacrifical grid of PLA between your actual finished piece and the bed itself That way you can pry the printed object from the bed and have more leaway for increased leverage without damage to your actual piece(use a plastic razor blade common in cell/tablet screen replacement kits and you generally won't scratch your printbed/printbed coating/tape The lattice/net of the raft would also generally have less in contact with the printbed surface area than a finished piece and thus have less holding power  Options to check in order of probability of occurenece and success Z-calibration Maybe you should perform calibration again It's possible that nozzle is now too close which causes the filament is spread on the heatbed which causes that the bottom surface is too flat It means all separate filament tracks are spilled and they create glass flat surface You did mention that the model sticks too much even to kapton It suggests z-calibration Temperature calibration Check if the temperature is not too high Reducing it a bit can reduce sticking If filament is too soft then material sticks usually better causes the same as in 1 Heatbed cleaning If your HB is scatched even not visible scratches then it's possible that previous printouts left little grains in such scratches Cleaning HB could then help Are you using glass if yes change glass side to check this option Eventually replace glass with new one Heatbed surface If your heatbed is scratched then filament can penetrate such scratches and increase sticking Filament Did you change filament vendor If not then maybe your filament had changed during a time/humidity/sun/cigarete smoke This is very doubtful option but who knows What methods you can use to detach model Paper knife I also have the same problem when I use paper glue stick Some vendors produce such sticky glue that I affraid to break a glass which I use of course When this happens I use a paper knife Glass is scratchproof enough Be careful if your model suddenly detaches releasing knife just be careful Unmount HB or unmount glass first of course Hammer I know people use hammer to detach sticked model I would suggest this method only for big and relatively simple elements Especially for solids fully filled with the material without any grid/honeycomb inner structure One short hit in the same surface as the HB Be careful of course and unmount HB or unmount glass first Fridge As HB material and filament have most likely different thermal shrinkage factor it might help And guess what unmount HB/glass first  Pour some 70 IPA along the edge of the model with a Q-tip it will pop out right away For larger models aaply IPA from a wash bottle This method also works well on other plastic to glossy surface bonds like for example hot melt glue to arylic sheet see this https www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9kdiZMqfmM  I suggest that you make a support not that much massive this kind of problem is often cause of a massive part printed directly on the bed You should place some easily destructible material between your part and the bed I don't know your part but even if you have a plane under it don't stick it to the bed Let a gap like 5 mm minimum which you will fill up with support Of course your support must be something light For example try to use the meshmixer supports meshmixer is free or some lattices supports if provided with your software's printer As they're supports and not the part you can destroy it more easily without the preoccupation to save it just caring about your bed Of course it depends on the amount your sticking problem if small things are sticky too this won't save you For non-used to supports people support is often a solution to main deformations and sticking problems Deformations because it dissipates the heat better sticking because it's much less massive material to remove  Several factors to consider but don't get discouraged it is definitely something you can solve Consider this Z height Lower Z squishes first layer more and increases sticking higher Z results in less plastic contacting the print surface and reduces sticking Tweaking your Z-height can help you dial-in your first layer adhesion Print Temperatures Higher extruder and bed temps during printing will tend to increase sticking Lowering temps will reduce sticking Run several tests just a few degrees can make a difference and finding the right balance can take some trial and error Removal Temperatures There is typically a warm bed removal temperature that works best when the bed has cooled but not all the way Anti-warp tabs If you're making your own models you can add a breakaway tab to the ends of parts that are prone to warping This improves surface area for hold down where you need it but takes minimal post processing to remove Dry your filament Warping is generally much worse when filament absorbs water from the air Some filaments such as polycarbonate are VERY prone to this but even PLA warping can be reduced by drying the filament To dry your filament you can use a low temperature in your oven make a drying bucket or my favorite put it under a vacuum with a vacuum pump Removal tricks Various methods of rapidly cooling the edge of the print with canned air alcohol etc can really help Thin metal spatulas can work wonders Try PEI on your print surface PEI is awesome Many common filaments stick very well while it's hot and release easily when it's cool Check out the way Lulzbot attaches their PEI print surface to all their printer beds It's a pretty easy and cheap mod The other factors I listed still matter but PEI makes it MUCH easier ",

        "answers": " This isn't a turn this knob and all will be well answer because your machine setup sounds pretty unique to what most people will have experience with Not being familiar with the older Stratasys printheads but based on my overall experience with 3D printers there are three things that could be an issue The nozzles are obstructed The way you talk about clearing the jams of pushing a tool up through the nozzle end would not effectively clear a jam it would only push the debris back into the print head just waiting to be pushed by the plastic back into the nozzle It could even be a piece of aluminum foil from the rebuild process The typical way jams like this are cleared is to do a cold pull where you heat up the hot end just enough to be able to pull the plastic out before it has really had a chance to liquify hopefully trapping the debris in the plastic then cut the end of the plastic off and reload The 90 degree bend in their design may make this very hard if not impossible to do Heat creep The tubes are a slightly smaller diameter and if heat is creeping up the print head and letting the filament expand in these tubes it may be expanding enough that it will no longer move through the print head Diagnose this by letting the printer jam then cool off for a few hours If you can print again for a short time period before it jams again this may be your issue where as an obstructed nozzle would not allow any more filament out Either turn down your temps or increase your cooling on the print head to address or get the original size tubes if possible Print head temperatures too low for the print speed The Stratasys Fortus 250mc I use runs ABS at about 300 degrees Many of the reprap printers run even higher than this for ABS The other thing to remember when ever you see people mention what temperatures they use is that this is relative and only a guide as what the temperature reads at the thermocouple or thermistor is usually slightly off from the temperature that is melting the plastic based on heater location in relation to the plastic and thermistor This can be diagnosed by printing until it jams pause the print for something like 30 seconds to let the hot end melt more plastic and then resume printing If resumes proper printing this may be your issue and it will jam again shortly if you do not adjust temps ",

        "answers": " I believe what you are experiencing is the stepper motors getting offset during the print usually due to the nozzle colliding into the model but possibly also due to very high printing speeds Basically the stepper motors used in most 3D printers will always make moves relative to their current position as opposed to absolute positioning In other words the stepper will for example be told to move 10 steps left regardless of where it is currently at If you therefore forcefully move the printhead out of position during the print the electronics will never know it happened and continue with instructions that are no longer viable In order to fix this do what you can to avoid the nozzle colliding into the model Make sure your printer does not leave large deposits of filament typically due to over extrusion or too close Z-leveling of the first layer Make sure the model sticks to the bed so that warped parts don't lift up obstructing the toolpaths Add Z-lift in your slicer software so that the printhead lifts slightly between travel moves Reduce travel speed if it is set very high the strength of stepper motors is lower at higher speeds which means nozzle collisions at higher speeds most likely will offset the motors ",

        "answers": " From the standpoint of a hobbyist user with a mid-range machine my answer is based on the model release from the build plate With a heated clean glass plate my model will almost always release once the plate has cooled The almost aspect means that if you want to use the print head to push the model clear you will be confronted with a stuck model occasionally The amount of force applied by the head may be enough to release a stuck model but may be is not going to be sufficient Especially with a core-xy system used by my Emblaser laser engraver you can either toss a belt or cause a stepper motor skipping More powerful motors will reduce the skipping possibility but not the belt jump problem You could consider to add one additional motor with a sweep arm geared in such a manner as to provide the necessary torque along with a force sensor to register a model stuck so badly as to be impossible to dislodge Your g-code would be written to lower the bed to the appropriate location to allow the sweep arm to operate while the force sensor would be tied into the pause/stop circuit of your controller Some controllers already have the ability to manage an additional motor as some are manufactured to provide for dual extrusion If such unattended operation is going to be a requirement you'd also want some form of aborting a failing or failed print  While the best method is probably unanswerable since it would be based on very specific requirements and subject to change as soon as a better method were devised here are some feasible methods to auto-eject 3d printed parts Some of these are methods that I've considered for my personal use others have been mentioned by others and added for helpful reference Some have been done others have not I think but all of them are feasible Scrolling Conveyor-type Bed In this concept parts become dislodged from the print surface as it is deformed around a roller in the process of scrolling to the next position Scrolling bed designs must make allowances to prevent parts from lifting up the bed material which becomes an issue especially with warp-prone materials Note This is the basis of the Automated Build Platform ABP originally designed as far as I can tell by Charles Pax and later covered in several patents by Makerbot Industries Deforming Bed In this concept the bed is mechanically deformed when the part removal temperature has been reached This deformation dislodges the part which can then be easily swept off of the bed by an arm or similar mechanism As far as I know this concept has not yet been demonstrated Articulated Segmented Bed In this concept the bed is comprised of several strips Slightly lowering a portion let's say half of the strips would separate them from the part then slightly raising that portion would separate the part from the remaining strips As far as I know this concept has not yet been demonstrated Eject and Replace Bed This method ejects the entire bed surface along with the finished parts and then receives a fresh print surface for the next print This method would likely still require intervention to remove parts from used print surfaces and then return them to the clean stack As far as I know this concept has not yet been demonstrated Plow This method mentioned by Fred_dot_u and AllanL uses a specially designed plow arm to sweep parts off the bed between prints This method has been effectively demonstrated in this video by New Valance Robotics Corporation that was mentioned by AllanL thanks Issues using print head to eject parts While this method has been tried and demonstrated see below it has some challenges/drawbacks Typical FDM/FFF 3d printers are not designed to apply significant force behind print head movements While a printer designed specifically for this purpose could be built using a typical printer in this way is extremely likely to cause the stepper motors to loose steps and result in loss of position accuracy unless parts separate very easily however position could easily be regained by zeroing via limit switches between prints In addition to skipping steps mechanical issues such as ratcheting/skipping belts or unwanted frame movement could result from even moderately stuck prints Examples of pushing or ramming parts off of bed While using various parts of the printer to push parts off of the bed may not be an ideal solution it may be an adequate solution for specific circumstances Here are a few demonstrations of the ramming method Ramming parts off with frame and moving bed like this Ramming part with robust print head like this Ramming easy to remove part with print head like this Interesting question I hope this helps  Here's a wild idea Since you're planning to have a bed which only moves in the Z-axis build a roller system which feeds a thin flexible layer of some material unobtanium I fear to cover the build plate The feed rollers have a weak spring to provide some tension to keep this layer flat but not overly stretched while building the part When the part is done lower the bed to zero while allowing the roller to retract excess parts of the sheet rollers on both sides of the build plate will have to do this At zero lock down the rollers and move the bed to some negative Z position causing the overlay sheet to pop free of the bed and ideally pop the printed parts loose as well Hey it could work ",
        "comments": "Asking about the best way is likely to result in a lot of opinion based answers Consider revising your question to something like is there an effective method or what methods have been used That way your question may become a useful reference for future seekers There's a similar question here http 3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/83/how-to-automate-printing-of-multiple-parts-continuously/146#146)Interesting but ramming is better suited to clearing bowling pins off the alley than taking out printed objects of unknown bond strength to the substrate and unknown internal stress resistance I agree Carl Ramming would not be a good general solution and I expect would be poorly suited for anyone like me who prints a wide variety of objects and filaments That said it could be an adequate specific solution for a sufficiently narrow set of requirements For example ramming may be perfectly adequate for someone running a hypothetical stretchlet factory In contrast I believe the first 3 methods are more viable for a broader range of prints with the eject and replace bed method being potentially suitable for any print.Edited the answer to remove the unintended suggestion that the ramming method was better than the other methods do you mean something like this https www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-5-a2NN2Vk ChrisThompson could you also add the suggestion by fred_dot_u about the plowing method https www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-5-a2NN2Vk That would make your answer a perfect reference for all future users @AllanL Added That's a well implemented solution isn't it?",

        "answers": " The ampacity question is not completely answerable because CAT6 does not specify wire gauge so the current limit will depend on the specific gauge you get CAT6 can be anywhere from 22 AWG to 24 AWG and depending on who you ask this can be good for as much as 7A or as little as 0.5A Given that you will have a bunch of wires in a bundle this may cause them to heat up more than if they were in free air For the steppers 1-2A a single wire should suffice but for the heater around 3-4A you might want to double up EMI will likely not cause any problems regardless of how you wire things up CAT6 cables have the wires twisted in pairs of 2 Some people recommend to take advantage of these pairs the 12V and GND of the heater should use a pair each of the two coils of the steppers should have their own separate pairs The reasoning behind this is that with equal current flowing in opposite directions in each wire of the pair the generated electromagnetic fields will cancel out Twisted pairs are usually used when dealing with multiple pairs of wires that are carrying high frequency signals that might affect each other The main concern for crosstalk in this application is if the stepper motor might cause the endstop to be erroneously triggered but this is only a concern during homing when the feedrate and thus frequency of the signal is low anyways  I did this for some of the wiring on my printer and it's working fine so far The two cautions are At tom pointed out the heater is the high current item so be careful of the wire gauge and avoid running the wire where air can't circulate well to cool it Wire ratings differ greatly depending on whether they're in a bundle poor air circulation or free For the most part I agree that EMI shouldn't be a problem but if you switch to thermocouples it might become a problem they're much more sensitive and this might have been part of the problem I described at How to get consistent and accurate readings from thermocouples though alternate wiring didn't completely solve the problem in that case  CAT6 cable by itself is not a problem it is typically 23 AWG solid core wire which can take you to 4A just fine The real problem comes from the connectors you use CAT6 usually goes hand in hand with 8p8c ethernet connectors which only have contacts rated to 500mA Also typically CAT6 cable is meant to be stationary hence the solid core wires so I'd go for something stranded McMaster sells some nice cheap cabling that fits your needs and it's actually meant for moving platforms like a CNC machine  I've used some cat 6 in one of my printers and just to be safe I used 4 wires for the extruder heat block 2 2 On the thermistors 1 is more than enough for each I also stripped the thick shielding off and used some curly cable organizer in it's place not the shielding on the wires but the cord So i could fit 2 cables in slightly more than the same space as one You are probably doing this to keep it organized too but this is an option if you run out of space in your wire runs ",

        "answers": " Your controller board probably requires calibration It sounds like maybe the extruder's stepper motor is not receiving sufficient current to make it turn Or somewhat confusingly maybe the stepper is receiving too much current and overheating You don't say which controller board you are using but regardless there should be an adjustable potentiometer on the board next to each of the stepper drivers or on the stepper driver daughter boards Like so This potentiomenter adjusts the reference voltage used to control the stepper motor From this reference voltage and the resistance of the stepper coils one can determine the current which is used to drive the stepper motor For the stepper driver of the extruder you could try turning this adjustable potentiometer slightly in order to provide more current to the stepper in turn to provide sufficient torque such that the motor is able to turn Or less current to stop the stepper from overheating The adjustments can be made whilst the power is on but a non-ferrous i e plastic screw driver should be used so as to avoid short circuits Also care needs to be taken when turning the potentiometer as they have been known to just fall apart whilst being turned If you are paranoid then make micro adjustments with the power turned off and then turn back on to check the behaviour Note it should go without saying that one should never disconnect a stepper whilst the power is on as both the driver and the stepper motor may be irrevocably damaged The photo above is taken from POTs Calibration RAMPS 1.4 If a POT is set too high then the associated stepper driver will tend to overheat and go into over-temperature thermal shutdown to prevent damage to its components The first sign of overheating is erratic stepper motor behavior Typically this can be recognized by the sounds of the stepper motor suddenly losing power thermal shutdown If no load or movement is required of the motor it is hard to detect whether it is over-powered as the driver is barely producing any heat and Conversely if the POT is set too low the stepper motor can enter an underpowered state This can be recognized by a lack of holding torque and a stepper motor that is skipping steps because the necessary movement requires a higher power demand than the POT setting allows for Driver cooling In addition to the possibility of the stepper motor over heating it could be possible that the stepper driver is overheating although the symptoms may be different to those that you are experiencing Regardless you may still find it advantageous to cooler the controller/driver board with a fan that is always on not temperature controlled Additional reading RigidWiki Stepper Driver Adjustment which goes into further detail about the adjustment of the potentiometers that I outlined above as well as the reference voltage and the adjustment thereof RepRap Wiki RepRapPro Setting Motor Currents describes a different controller to yours but goes into the process of adjustment and description of the reference voltage which is applicable to all boards The wiper on each potentiometer generates a DC voltage that is sent to the chip This is the reference voltage it defines how much current the stepping motor driver chip supplies to the motor The bigger the reference voltage VREF the higher the current A that the chip will send to the motor For most NEMA14 motors the current maximum is 1A but this will generally cause it to get warm so a setting of 750mA is recommended For NEMA17 motors depending on size the limit on current is generally between 1.3A and 1.7A If you drive stepper motors with more current than they were designed for the motor will get hot and may be damaged Pololu A4988 Stepper Motor Driver Carrier with Voltage Regulators this is a very common stepper driver MyHomeFab DRV8825 Adjust Stepper Current goes into the adjustment of the reference voltage for the commonly used DRV8825 which is an alternative to the popular A4988 This thread about non-actuating steppers may also be useful Motors which mentions setting the trimpots and points the OP to RepRap Wiki Pololu stepper driver board which in turn refers to this thread Strange stepper behavior and this video video-2012-02-02-16-37-26.mp4 which describes a jitter in the stepper behaviour  I also faced similar problem Mine was a self-made marlin/repetier The problem was that the motor current was much less than the motor requirement and the axis were not calibrated properly Giving recommended current according to your motor ratings and limiting your feedrate according to your calibration should work  If the stepper never turns even with no filament loaded it is more likely to be a bad connection to one of the two coils or a bad stepper driver or a bad motor Seems to be a frequent enough problem that they supplied a spare driver with my machine Perhaps you can try swapping drivers to see if the problem follows the driver You can disconnect the motor with power off and measure the coil resistances with a multimeter to see if they are sensible which will weed out a bad harness connector or motor ",

        "comments": "Are you restricting yourself to using OpenSCAD to accomplish this assembly process?I am currently restricting to OpenSCAD because I can import my OpenSCAD framework and parts into Thingiverse and make this tool easily accessible to the open-source 3D print community I realized I wasn't clear enough in my original post about the concept I'll clarify.That's a fantastic idea my actual concept is deeper in design it's a customizable figure generator based on a STL parts library.That's an interesting and admirable objective I'll drop back to my answer posted below and suggest that the parametric manipulation of translate and rotate may give you the desired results You would have to be certain to create appropriate parameters to be passed to the modules when combined If you create a figure of x total height the individual components would translate to x x part 1 x part 2 or something similar I like OpenSCAD but I'm a mediocre coder Perhaps your strengths are greater than mine.I hope you'll toss a link here when you get the coding figured out.I think that the project hinges on fairly standard dimensions If I can build a set of OpenSCAD files that have a series of fixed positions and I can prepare a series of model parts that can essentially be modular this will work.Certainly shall!I'll have to investigate a bit and find out!",

        "answers": " The reason holes come out undersized is generally the slicer so calibrating the printer itself cannot solve the issue without making other things worse The output of the printer is exactly what it should be given the G-code provided to it It's just that the G-code does not represent the hole diameter correctly It would be best to simply account for the deviation in your design or simply drill out undersized holes to the correct diameter  Even in traditional manufacturing milling lathe router etc dimensions are often times offset to accommodate unforeseen variables such as cutting tool wear material hardness and especially operator/engineering error As Tom van der Zanden stated it is common for holes to come out undersized This is not a conscious action but a result of uncompensated variables in the material When you phase the material by heating it to near or at melting point the material technically begins changing With that can come varying changes in melting and cooling rates Your slicing engine will not understand what should be compensated and what shouldn't So I would suggest Aiming for the lower tolerance for your hole size If you don't have a tolerance just make one up and aim for about 0.5mm-1mm below your target hole size Ream the hole using a reamer or drill utilizing the 3D printed hole as a pilot Be wary of 3D hole positions If a hole is oriented in compound angles meaning that it is not directly in-line with an axis plane such as XY XZ or YZ then you may also have misshapen holes These may result in positional errors if you decide to ream them out  Make sure you know what purpose the holes are to serve If they are clearance holes i.e designed so that the screw or bolt slides thru easily then there's nothing wrong with a slight oversize If you want a tappable hole i.e either drive threads for a machine screw or self-tap with wood/drywall screws then you want to go undersized If you want the hole to be a close-fit with a non-threaded rod as is done for maintaining alignment for moving parts then almost certainly start undersized and clear the hole just enough to fit the desired rod  I've had this issue too and I've pretty much solved it by making all holes polygons instead of round The general rule of thumb I follow is to use a polygon with 4 times as many sides as the hole diameter in millimeters e.g for a hole with a 3 mm diameter I'd use a 12 sided polygon Then it's a matter of choosing between a circumscribed circle fits inside polygon or an inscribed polygon fits inside circle polygon depending on what you're using the hole for ",

        "answers": " In this case I would like to first recommend replacing your PTFE tube with a better quality product Unfortunately the quality:price ratio is as to be expected here My reasoning PTFE has great thermal properties for a polymer just like ABS In fact the glass-transition state begins at relatively the same temperature between the two materials ABS starts transitioning at about 105&deg;C and about 127&deg;C for PTFE However PTFE traditionally has a much higher melting point at about 327&deg;C as opposed to the usual 125&deg we use in 3D printing My Point I think the hardware you currently have has low-quality PTFE PTFE can be recycled for re-use in other PTFE products In recycled PTFE you can lose a lot of the desired properties in the material true for any material This includes both the ideal friction-less and thermal resistance we need in 3D Printing What I think happened The higher print temperatures of ABS transitioned the PTFE into its glass-state As the throat expands the path of least resistance in the assembly is towards the extruder motor since the nozzle holds more pressure I would not recommend fixing this problem with a retainer By forcing the PTFE throat to stay in position you could potentially force the PTFE to expand in other ways Most likely resulting in constricting the filament leading to grinding of filament on the drive gear and clogging of the nozzle Worst case you end up with gooey PTFE in your nozzle and/or around your retainer  I see you want to Block the tefflon tube from going Up and Out of the extruder Yes I see no reason why you would not fid a nut cap Drill a hole and have it work There is likely a special nut cap with a pre existing hole in it already but I decided the keywords was asking for bad results on a work computer The only thing I can see happening is you will 1 possibly not have the clearance 2 have a larger thermal mass ",

        "answers": " Oh thats simple First you will see the elephants foot on first layers if you have the extruder over-extruding or do not have enough distance between the bed and nozzle It's very common that the first couple of layers of a print is wider than you expected them to be This is because you will generally want to make sure the first layer is nicely squished into the build platform so that it sticks properly By doing this the plastic gets squished out into a thicker line than normal and thus the bottom of the print will bulge out a bit like an elephant's foot You can decrease this effect by leveling your bed so that the nozzle is slightly further away from the bed and lowering the bed temperature a bit It's hard to get rid of this effect entirely without sacrificing bottom layer quality and bed adhesion It will be easier on small prints as they are less likely to warp and detach from the platform and you can therefore get away with not squishing the first layer as hard See this visual guide on more information If you are seeing this on all layers That means you have oozing When your printer hits the end of the line It has to slow down stop and start the next vector During this time if your printing very hot you will ooze material at this intersection Also the extra time over that spot mayhaps also warm the corner causing more disruption Best thing in this situation is to verify you cannot lower temps more Add a fan Also double check that you are extruding the exact amount you think you are distance of material and the material size average Here is another visual trouble shooting guide I will note I don't think thats too bad If it needs to fit into something just clip it  If it's on each corner and not the layer change corner it's a combination of overshoot and the short pause of the printer when it changes direction You can minimize it but it won't go away 100 due to overshoot from direction changes usually models with a slight rounded corners work great If you say increase the jerk as an experiment and they get sharper but you obviously have to deal with potential ringing artifacts then it's due to that pause and acceleration after a direction change I would try lowering the temperature a bit to slow the flow/oozing of the nozzle and calibrate extrusion just to keep the settings tight as possible to keep dimensional accuracy but not under extrude obviously If it's where a layer change occurs tweak and play with retraction settings such as coasting and extra distance on restart you can put negative values here Once those are set as an advanced tweak try to max the z speed Obviously this involves motor current testing for skipped steps etc but this would make the layer change a bit quicker to further reduce oozing due to the delay in layer changes if retraction settings don't fix it Usually you can fix the corners with retraction settings but then it can mess up other parts of a model since those settings are global I wish slicers were more intelligent  Three factors that will impact the sharpness of corners first is your extruder speed second is retraction rate and third is nozzle diameter By slowing down your extruder will be able to track the features of your model better I generally try to print with extruder speeds of 10mm/s which gives fairly good results The nozzle diameter will be the most extreme limiting condition on how sharp you can get your corners This I think is likely your issue Retraction rate could have an effect on the corner sharpness I don't think that's the problem you're experiencing but worth mentioning Depending on the specific geometry if your nozzle stops at a corner while it raises in Z if your retraction is too low additional filament can ooze out making the corners appear more rounded Typically a nozzle diameters are about 0.4mm which is pretty sharp however if you have something larger that could effect it as well Again not your specific issue but something to keep in mind for future builds ",

what happens Agree with Tom Likely your too high up I take a piece of paper and try to get the distance just so when moving the paper between the nozzles and the bed it has some resistance but not too much  Your photo has shadows which seem to suggest that your tape layer has some wrinkles That won't help Try removing that tape and laying down the fabulous blue painter's tape If you read any dedicated forum for plastic extruder printers you'll find plenty of claims that X or Y is the best way to guarantee adhesion Some folks swear by glass+gluestick others by PEI sheet and so on The only general consensus is that use of a brim or a raft is highly recommended so as to increase the total contact area  I've been struggling to work out what is wrong with the process where you claim to be leveling the bed OK and the print is starting in mid air Now I remember I had exactly the same problem with my first prints I think you are leveling OK but getting some binding in the Z-axis As the head jumps to start printing it goes up then down but not as far due to some mechanical problem So although your Z-endstop is aligned with the bed after finding the zero the head is not reliably able to move and return to zero Check these questions for more detailed ideas about how to fix this Z-axis steppers and bed alignment problems z-axis hard to move in some areas what could be faults how to improve You can try and confirm my diagnosis by zeroing them moving Z-position up 2/3 of the full travel and back down See if it is still at the position where you leveled it to If it is not this I suspect your Z-endstop may be giving unreliable results Check the microswitch is securely mounted I ended up replacing mine with an optical sensor and have seen huge improvements in repetability lt;0.1mm rather than around rms 0.3mm from zero to zero  You can use the masking tape as base however the height of nozzle is higher than required Check that your fist layer height is 70 lower than your nozzle size In my opinion this can be the step layer minus 0.05 for example layer height is 0.2 then my first layer is 0.15 this makes that the material squizes a little more If this is not possible you might change the offset of printing level until you reach the height required Manually you can add some layers of masking tape to minimize the overgap within the nozzle and bed some times I do this due mi home 3D printer gets out of calibration on changing nozzles For PLA i\u00b4m using 210\u00b0C because using 190 and 200 makes some balls like your photo also try to use a lower speed like 90 or 80 to allow a good melting inside the heater  Eureka All of the other answers and suggestions on this post were all very helpful and would likely be the right answers 90 of the time but they didn't give me any relief I spent a bunch of time watching YouTube videos about 3D printing and I started to notice a difference in size of the lines of plastic being laid down on the build plate In the videos the lines of plastic looked bigger Mine were very fine lines That lead me down a series of different search terms until I found some other videos that talked about nozzle cleaning I noticed that one of the symptoms they mentioned was that when the plastic would come out of the nozzle that it would curve around That's a sign that it's partially blocked and causing it to bend and curve After the people in the YouTube videos cleaned their nozzle the plastic would then extrude and drop straight down If my nozzle was partially blocked and only about half the right amount of plastic was coming out that would make sense since there wouldn't be enough surface area of the plastic to make a good connection to the build surface I acquired some 0.4mm drill bits from Amazon and followed the instructions on this YouTube video Sure enough when using the 0.4mm drill bits I could tell the nozzle was clogged After clearing it out the plastic started extruding in a straight line down just like the video I was stoked I tried another print and it was NIGHT AND DAY I was finally getting nice plump lines that stuck to the build plate I still had an issue or two on certain parts of my build plate but I think that's because in all of my tries I had damaged the masking tape I put down new blue tape and started up my print and it's BEAUTIFUL Thank you all very much for your help Hopefully this will be helpful to someone else as well ",

        "answers": " I am not entirely familiar with the ANET A8 electronics but it's very unlikely it's any different from how any other mainboard works so any instructions that work for RAMPS should work for your board as well The sensor you linked to has an operating voltage range of 6V to 36V However the endstop connectors on any mainboard I've come across only provide 5V not enough for the sensor to work You could verify that this is also the case for your ANET board with a multimeter Assuming the colour coding is standard you'll need to connect the black wire to GND the red wire to 12V and the yellow wire through a diode to the signal pin of the endstop connector The anode of the diode should connect to the signal pin and the cathode to the wire coming from the sensor The diode is required because otherwise the 12V signal from the sensor will damage your electronics which can only accept 5V Any ordinary diode will do for instance 1N4148 You should enable endstop pullups in your firmware when using this method though if your board already has physical pullups this is not necessary but won't hurt either Note that if the sensor is inductive it will also need an appropriate metal surface to trigger off Unfortunately it is not clear from the product description what type of sensor you have bought and amusingly gearbest doesn't know either Question Hello is this Sensor capazitiv or induktiv Thank you verry much Reply It is an auto leveling sensor for 3D printers  You will have to Find and print something on Thingiverse to mount sensor Change firmware to Skynet and change the offset values accordingly in order for the new sensor to recognize the bed There is official Facebook page of Anet A8 printers as well as Skynet firmware You can ask there if you need further help Though the above steps are easy  I'm guessing you have the Anet sensor If so and you are using the stock firmware that came with your A8 it's not going to recognise the sensor but you can download and flash the Anet A8L firmware that is designed to run with the sensor from the Anet site I stumbled on this while searching for stock firmware I hope this helps you out ",

        "answers": " Proceeding with the expectation that you mean nylon rather than vinyl there are a few options open for you What resolution are you seeking Layer thickness of 0.100 mm is quite good allowing for ten layers per mm of part thickness with infill adjusted as required If you've already determined that your printer will not print at the resolution required for your gear design you would perhaps purchase a higher resolution printer Of course that may be an expense you would like to avoid If your parts count is small you could consider to print samples of the parts to confirm fit but not worry about strength and then use an online service to have them printed via SLS method Selective Laser Sintering places nylon powder on the work surface then selectively melts the powder into a solid Each layer when completed is covered with another layer of powder and fused to the previous portion or not until the part is complete Because the un-fused powder provides support there is no requirement for the model to have supplemental support structures There is a requirement/objective that the part have drain holes in areas which might otherwise be solid Any surface that entraps powder is charged to the purchaser as if the space within is included in the part An example would be a cube that can be printed as six square faces only The cube wall thickness can be specified and if a drain hole is incorporated the cost would be the volume of the walls only No drain hole would mean the cube would be charged for the entire volume For gears which are typically low profile/flat items that's a minor consideration The same concept applies to SLA printing which uses a laser in a vat of resin If the model is a solid with no drain holes the interior will retain the resin It is possible that the interior can be cured with strong UV light and/or sunlight but opaque resins would not accept this work-around nor would it reduce the cost involved Also note that SLA printed items would lack the necessary strength If farming out your parts is the direction you intend to travel ensure the dimension stability reference in the vendor you use Nylon sintered parts will shrink a known amount during the fusing process The vendor should provide the appropriate reference or the vendor should confirm that he adjusts the model appropriately for shrinkage I have one very tiny part constructed from SLS nylon and it's amazingly strong for such a thin wall Nylon wears well too  If changing the nozzle to a smaller diameter is a viable alternative for your printer then that may give a major increase in your X-Y-resolution You can think of it like drawing with a pencil vs a thick crayon a fine tip allows for fine details Personally I have done some printing with a 0.25mm nozzle which was a bit of a challenge to find good slicer settings for but otherwise went very well giving much better resolution than my 0.4mm nozzle nearly twice a good to be exact ",

        "answers": " I never used one but the thing that makes two parts stick together is the atmospheric pressure The glue is just a thing that even if it does not make any chemical bond is keeping the air out A pure example of that is if you put water in a glass and then put another one on it Although the water is not glue you can't easily pull it up and if the surface is big you can't at all It is the atmospheric pressure that keeps them together and the water keeps the air out I suggest try the other side and see I'm just guessing Good luck  Well Not all adhesives are all about chemical bonding.Also i don t think that the issue is the heat expansion Also the atmospheric pressure is underestimated here when you put your hand to a house vacuum,for example,the force that makes you hand stuck to the vacuum s end is the pressure of the atmosphere https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive  Perhaps this is due to the aluminum build plate warping/crowning as it heats I use a PEI print surface on my Monoprice Maker Select Wanhao Di3 which has an 8.5\"x8.5 build plate and I've had no issues with the PEI coming unstuck However instead of attaching mine directly to the aluminum heated build plate I attached it using 3M 468 to a piece of Borosilicate glass which is then attached to my aluminum build plate using silicone thermal heatsink pads The rational for using a Borosilicate glass print surface is that a heated metal build surface is going to warp or move some as the heat is coming from one side the glass will not warp and so you have a completely flat surface on which to print and the heatsink pads help make up the difference in surface geometry I used this 3dprinterwiki article as the basis for my glass bed mod and applied the PEI/adhesive using another source which I've forgotten possibly the RepRap wiki While the first link is Wanhao Di3 specific it covers the idea Make sure you tweak your z-endstops if needed on your particular machine as adding the glass plat raises the bed height by several mm Please note that I'm theorizing I did not ever try applying my PEI directly to my aluminum build plate so I have no direct comparison But the use of glass to eliminate build plate warping/crowning is fairly well documented See also this 3DPSE Answer ",

        "body": " TL;DR What needs to be done to the following model to ensure a successful print As part of a father-son project we're trying to make an enclosure for a digital clock The idea is to make a 3D printed model of a rocket with a hollow body to hold the electronics The main body consists of two halves that will press-fit together with some integrated mounting locations for the display micro-controller etc Since this is our first 3D printing project I would like to know what can be done to the following model to help ensure a successful first print We have not chosen a material or supplier yet but I suspect we'll go with PLA since it seems to be quite common inexpensive available in lots of colours etc The model is not yet complete there are several details missing like additional mounting locations but I was hoping to make corrections to what we already have before too much further just in case it requires a complete restart Here are some possibly relevant details and goals The shell thickness is currently 2.5 mm We would like the shell to be translucent to allow a glowing effect from some internal LEDs The nose cone and thruster not shown will probably have pins that press-fit into the top and bottom of both halves of the shell to hold them together There is a 0.5 mm clearance between the lip on the front shell and the detent on the rear shell The rectangular window will possibly be removed or made into a flip-open door There aren't a lot of hard requirements as this is just a learning project so we're willing to change almost anything about the design as long as we can fit in the existing clock parts The Fusion 360 model is available to view online if it helps Rocket Concept 3 ",

quite well It took sometime for me to get it dialed in I've found that Bed Level Z-axis height and Print Speed are usually what makes the most difference I have only used Inland PLA Microcenter brand and can get good quality prints I would recommend double checking bed level z-axis and going through print quality trouble shooting Re-measure your PLA thickness and make sure your print multiplier is adjusted appropriately and try to slow down your print speed If you could post a link to a sample file that you're trying to print It may be helpful Simplify 3D has a wonderful trouble shooting guide you can check out here  I've not done much miniatures printing but I have the same printer and I happen to have the exact same filament loaded Also I've been doing a lot of tuning lately including this z-brace mod which has improved my overall print quality so I thought I'd take a pass at printing the Knight from your photos and sharing my findings First I've posted a series of pictures to show my findings Overall I'd say my print quality was better than what you showed in your photos but still isn't good enough I sliced with Cura 15.04.6 and printed from SD card Here are my Full settings Layer height mm 0.1 Shell thickness mm 0.5 Enable retraction Yes Bottom/Top thickness mm 0.3 Fill Density 20 Print Speed mm/s 20 Printing Temperature C 210 Bed Temperature C 67 Support Type Everywhere

cooling fan Yes I do most of my printing with a later height of 0.2mm but for a detailed mini 0.1mm is probably the largest that will look good and probably the smallest possible on this printer I normally set most of my speeds to 50 mm/s with first layer at 20 mm/s for this I slowed it all to 20 mm/s due to the fine details and I think it helped Temps of 67\u02daC bed and 210\u02daC extruder are what I've found to work best on my machine for PLA after much experimentation but your machine may vary I'm not sure how accurate the temperature measurements are on these machines 67\u02daC gives me an observed bed temp of 60\u02daC but that's at the top surface I have PEI atop Borosilicate glass adhered to the bare aluminum bed with silicone-based heat transfer pad I think I miscalculated the top/bottom heights and infill I'm not used to printing at 0.1mm layer height but 3 top layers over 20 infill is clearly not enough see the closeup of the mini's base in my linked gallery Next print I'll either try 0.6mm top/bottom or much higher infill The supports came off easily I used a pair of sidecutters from my electronics bench A little more cleanup with a sharp hobby knife combined with a better base top layer would probably produce an acceptable result There were two major flaws The first are the little blobs on many layers see for example the inseam area on the picture of the knight's back Ed Nisley at Softsolder.com calls these Reveral Zits and I think the name is apt These happen when the print head needs to quickly reverse direction or stop-move-print but filament continues to extrude I use fairly aggressive retraction settings and I think my print shows smaller zits than yours but still far too many Ed has explored this topic in some depth it's possible my extruder stepper isn't keeping up with my settings due to mechanical limits This is an area I want to pursue but I don't have time at the moment I plan to read Ed's work and try some experiments on my machine to see if I can get better results I will update this answer if/when I do As it stands most of them are quite small and could probably be cleaned up with a knife the worst are those around unsupported areas such as the back of the shoulder guard The second major flaw is the helmet It's just bad I'm not sure the printer has much hope of nailing those horns but overall the head is just bad I'm not sure what can be done there To summarize disc0ninja's advice on Bed Level and Print speed are certainly the right place to start You might want to try my Cura settings to see if you get similar results Also the Z-brace mod I linked to above has made a big difference for me I rarely have to adjust my leveling anymore I also plan to try slicing with Slic3r which I haven't used previously but have been looking into You mentioned you couldn't print with Slic3r was that USB or SD Card I'd suggest trying via SD if it failed during USB printing Update 30 Jan 2017 It took a little doing but I managed to slice and print this model via slic3r I had some issues with the original STL in slic3er which I ended up fixing with a free trial at makeprintable.com I spent a lot of time fiddling with slic3r it has a lot more knobs to turn than Cura and I make no claims of having the best settings for this print There are so many settings that rather than transcribe them here I've captured them in my pictures of the slic3er print Overall I feel like the quality is higher The reversal zits are hardly noticeable but the big remaining problem is one I didn't fully diagnose in the original Cura print lack of support for areas such as the shoulders Slic3r added more support than Cura but it's also harder to separate from the base The head isn't great but much better than the Cura print I don't think my photos show it as well as it looks This print has convinced me that there's plenty of quality still to be wrung from this printer I hope to make time to do some more slic3r prints of this model while tweaking the params to see what's possible If I make any big leaps in quality I will update this answer ",

        "answers": " This is not a definitive answer and has turned into a ramble as I have not yet had to change my filament size However initially I would have thought that only the hotend and the hotend's nozzle would need to be changed from one that can handle the 1.75 mm filament to 3 mm If the extruder is spring loaded then it should adjust itself to the thicker filament without a problem If not then you may have to do a slight manual adjustment However after doing some further reading there may be other factors that need to be considered such as Extruder gearing Melt time which would imply a different feed rate It could be worth having a close look at the aperture of your hotend If in the unlikely situation it looks as if the hotend would accept 3 mm or if you could remove the lining so that it can you may not need to actually change any hardware but instead just try tweeking the feedrate in the software because as your nozzle is less than the width of the filament anyway then it will be fine for both 1.75 mm and 3 mm A 3 mm filament would require more heating and therefore a slower feedrate than a 1.75 mm feedrate Once the filament has melted so long as the pressure from the extruder is sufficient then the molten filament should come out of the nozzle However this may be a less than satisafctory method and result in some dubious prints There is an interesting thread on the RepRap wiki 1.75mm Filament vs 3mm Filament that discusses most of the points above It should be noted that the advantages of 3 mm filament has over 1.75 mm are that it is cheaper stiffer less flexible and thus easier to push through the hotend As an aside one interesting point raised in the thread is that maybe a smaller extruder can be used for the narrower 1.75 mm filament thus resulting in a lighter print head I am not sure how true that is This article Converting a 3D printer from 3mm to 1.75mm does the reverse of what you want and comes with a video It states that as you have already found that the hotend needs to be changed The printer Thomas is changing out to accept 1.75mm is the Lulzbot Mini one of the most popular printers that would ever need this modification The only required materials is a new hot end suitable for 1.75mm filament a 4mm drill and a few wrenches and allen keys It would be a smart idea to get a hot end that uses the same thermistor as the old one but that\u2019s not a deal-breaker as the problem can be fixed in the firmware Alternatively you could leave your printer as it is and use a 3mm to 1.75mm filament converter which may be a bit of overkill for just one reel of filament 1 The bottomline To be honest is it worth the hassle time and expense of having to modify and re-calibrate your printer or worst case change the model of the printer just for the price of a reel of filament assuming that you did not bulk purchase a bunch of reels It may be better to stick to one filament size i.e your original size for all of your projects and so resell the reel of 3 mm and stick with the 1.75 mm printer and buy the correct filament 2 1 See also Conversion of 3mm ABS filament to 1.75mm 2 See also Tom's answer to Conversion of 3mm ABS filament to 1.75mm See also Can 1.75mm filament be used in a printer that takes 3mm filament  Well Usually when one buys a 30 dollar roll of plastic they don't replace a 1k machine That said you can change out the extruder The extruder is what matters So if you have a Prusa i3 you can go and buy say a e3d hot end that is made for 3mm Usually we see 3mm on Bowden printers like the Ultimaker Everyone else has moved to 1.8 I would just toss this on craigslist and get the correct plastic ",

sure you have temps calibrated well Too hot is more warp use a raft The makerbot uses a raft and no heated bed make sure the room is not drafty Having it by the window will result in warping Adding a large brim also helps I find good ol Glue sticks work the best at keeping the print to the bed SMASH the first layer This one is controversial I personally do first layer at 130 and print speed of 30 You get elephants foot sure but its on the bed real good Tom is right It is very very hard to print that big of a piece without warping That said I have done very large pieces on my ultimaker Fan glue stick matterhacker pro pla and no raft But again that's on an ultimaker Note you can build a heat chamber pretty easily Specifically a passive heat chamber  For PLA I use a brim The other thing that makes a big difference is obsessive care in levelling the bed and setting the Z-origin Ideally the first layer extruded including the brim should be almost squished onto the bed rather than being laid down at a height that allows a near-circular cross-section If the extruder head is too low almost no filament will come out If it's too high there'll be very little adhesion FWIW I think a heated bed helps here as it slows the cooling of this first layer and improves the adhesion as the fluid-phase grabs the surface  Curling As printed plastic parts cool the different areas of the object can cool at different rates 1 Depending upon the parts being printed this effect can lead to warping and curling Although PLA has a much lower shrinkage factor than ABS both can warp and curl potentially ruining a print There are some very common ways to deal with this potential problem the most notable being a heated build platform However sometimes that might not be enough Use a heated build platform A heated build platform helps keep the lowest levels of a print warm as the higher layers are printed This allows the overall print to cool more evenly A heated build platform sometimes abbreviated as HBP helps tremendously with just about any ABS print and large PLA prints Print with a raft Rafts are a printing option in ReplicatorG and Skeinforge They\u2019re basically a large flat lattice work of printed material underneath the lower-most layer of your printed object They\u2019ll also help reduce warping and curling by allowing your printed object to adhere better to your flat build surface Other variations on this are to print with a larger raft and/or a thicker raft comprised of more layers Calibrate your starting Z height A good first layer makes all the difference If your starting Z axis height is too high the extruded filament won\u2019t be able to make a good bond with the platform If you think your Z axis starting height is too high try lowering it by 0.05mm increments until you find a good first layer Get the right build surface Some people have experimented with different surfaces such as steel titanium glass different kinds of plastic different kinds of tape and foam board However I find both ABS and PLA seem to stick really well to hot or warm Kapton tape Clean your build surface ABS and PLA stick better to a clean build surface Keep it clean of dust pieces of old prints and any other debris Print slower Printing slower allows finer detail better adhesion to the build surface and lower layers and gives the printed part more time to cool evenly Print cooler Printing at a lower temperature isn\u2019t always an option Ideally you should be printing at the lowest temperature required for extrusion and that allows good interlayer adhesion However trying lower temperatures isn\u2019t for the faint of heart Printing at a too low a temperature could cause harm to your extruder motor or extruder Eliminate drafts or enclose your robot Forrest Higgs found that having his 3D printer too close to an open window caused very uneven heating across his build surface This in turn caused the side of his prints closest to the window to curl Since keeping the window closed wasn\u2019t an option for him he compensated for the window drafts by adding a heat lamp Cupcake and Thing-O-Matic owners might have an easier time of eliminating drafts by simply enclosing two or three of the sides of their robots It will also have a fortunate side effect of helping to control fumes Design with mouse ears Zach Smith\u2019s solution was to add little discs to corners of an object to help those corners stick to the platform These essentially serve as mini-rafts to give those corners more surface area and better adhesion without having to print an entire raft Design with aprons to hold down corners Forrest Higgs suggested adding aprons around an object to be printed while that object was being printed on a raft These low thick pieces of plastic help keep the raft flat and help prevent any curling or warping from affecting the desired printed object itself Design with surrounding thermal walls While Forrest Higgs apron approach provides a mechanical advantage of essentially holding down corners with a chunk of plastic Nophead has added thin surrounding walls to his designs to act as baffles to keep warm air around the printed object as it moves around He\u2019s postulated that a very thin surrounding wall could have the same beneficial effect as printing inside an enclosed build chamber Interestingly it seems that Nophead suggests that designing objects with more rounded corners might also help avoid curling and warping at those corners Reduce infill When printing a model you can chose to print it hollow completely solid or some percentage between zero and 100 However as Nophead points out even the plastic inside a model exerts a force on the entire printed object as it cools It stands to reason that the more plastic you have the more those pieces of plastic will pull against themselves and the build surface as they cool By reducing infill there will a reduced amount of internal tension as the object cools Reducing these internal forces by printing with a lower infill ratio can help reduce curling and warping as well  It might be useful you confirm again the bed levelling I had warp on big pieces despite I thought my bed was properly leveled but in fact for some reasons the bed was too far from the head on one corner If you face the same issue you should see the bottom part of your print is showing the filaments not well melted to each others on the 1st layer I really make sure the nozzle is gripping my paper sheet almost scratching it when I move the paper ",
        "comments": "What material are you printing with If it's ABS there's pretty much no chance of printing a 10x10cm piece without warping if you don't have a semi enclosed printer.Whether a fan helps depends on the material with ABS typically not so much I'm not sure I'd recommend a raft I think they're a bit antiquated.I am assuming it is PLA as they are doing 60c Far as a raft my Makerbot can do some impressive prints without a heated bed But the makerbot guys have some serious knowhow behind them Too bad they didn't choose to do a high quality printer)Sorry I forgot to mention my material I use PLA.I have found a 5mm brim http 3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/20/what-are-main-differences-between-rafts-skirts-and-brims/60 really helps prevent corner lift.@Davo I agree that w PLA a brim is a great help but see my answer as well.Updated to include brims I did not mean for a brim to replace other suggestions but rather to supplement them.At least part of this answer the first line in fact has be taken verbatim from an article on pintrest https www.pinterest.com/pin/502081058432749654 You need to provide a reference and URL is you are copying content from other parts of the web.@MentorsHouse please consider providing attribution for articles when you copy and paste them as your answer I believe this https www.makerbot.com/media-center/2011/06/23/12-ways-to-fight-warping-and-curling is the article you copied so please include this link and attribution to the article in your answer.Also posting a giant article is quite the eye sore I did not replace",

        "answers": " It probably won't be fair Incidentally I have a decent amount of experience with 3D printing It depends heavily on the particular technology that you're using to do the 3D printing but nearly all forms of printing aren't perfect depending on the design you make solid honeycombed hollow there will be slight or not-so-slight variations across the faces which will result in an unfair die In particular the faces that are parallel to the build surface will probably be different compared to the ones that are angled You could probably deal with some of these problems with some kind of post-processing but honestly at that point buying dice would be easier 3D printing is for making custom or prototype objects and isn't really suited to mass production of simple shapes like dice Even manufactured dice have some imperfections and a slightly unfair die probably won't make much of a difference in gameplay but it will be hard for you to determine whether the imperfections from 3D printing are severe enough to make the die unfair without rolling it many times and looking at its distribution Again at that point it's easier to just buy the dice That being said custom d20s can be super cool looking and if you're going to 3D print something might as well make it look cool  Custom 3D printed dice are distinctly lower quality than the dice from a FLGS you see in standard dice sets and around the same quality of die as the cheaper plastic dice available online It depends somewhat on your printer but you can get very uniform results in terms of material density with the issues in die fairness being limited to problems with the surfaces e.g the sides aren't usually all the same texture You can fix this with statistical modelling and sanding to get a very good die but it takes forever and is a huge pain and is totally not worth it from a practical standpoint A quick sanding to get all faces roughly the same texture is usually good enough in my experience You can also just print the die so that the build-surface face and the face parallel with it if it's not a d4 are unimportant faces like the 10 and 11 on a d20 being smoother they'll be rolled a little less often but the average roll will be the same regardless of what number pair that effects if you keep the opposite sides sum to die size 1 rule A quick sanding doesn't take too long and works well though that's definitely what I would recommend from my experience As a note the main advantage in 3d printing dice is that it's affordable whereas otherwise acquiring truly custom dice weighted to specification unusual number of sides etc requires you to make them by hand or shell out many thousands of dollars 3d printed dice are particularly useful when you want to concoct biased dice as you can easily alter things like the physical die size weight by altering how much of the interior is hollow weight distribution by altering where the hollow cavities are known as floaters when these gaps are used to bias the roll much less good than weighting and number placement to conceal the differences between your die and a fair die you 3d printed In my experience 3d printed dice work fine for RPGs but feel a little light at least with my feedstock I used them for a bit with a group I GMed for while on a bit of a 3d printing kick and they definitely have some niche uses but beautiful high-quality dice with a good feel to them are so cheap nowadays I just don't see any reason to go to the expense and trouble when you can avoid it  Well it is a bit more complicated than that Changes are the d20 you buy in the store is a bit more favored as well Now we are talking statically it will like one side over the other As the difference in weight distribution is not drastic if you print it solid it will not matter In use you likely will not see it That said if you wanted to be extra sure I would use the 3d printed model make a silicon mold with it Then use Resin to make the dice Now you can start making whole batches of dice as good as what you get in the store My final answer is technically it will favor but you will not notice  Pretty much all die are unfair to an extent If you are seriously concerned about accuracy then you will need to test what you produce and if not satisfactory modify the design reprint and retest A simple/coarse test is to float your die in very salty water and note which face faces upwards repeatedly perturb the die noting the upwards face Any egregious bias should reveal itself after a handful of perturbations Note that this test only reveals that a die has a bias not which face it is biased to land on It's also probably not massively accurate but should be good enough to let you gauge whether your printed die are any worse than your shop bought ones  I've printed a few dice and thrown them 100 times each to check they were very far off from fair One reason I think is that the inner fill and thus a lot of weight is oriented a certain way It might help to do solid-fill or no fill but I haven't compared yet  Not likely Creating true fair dice is fairly difficult to do even with high tolerance processes 3D printing hobbyist level is much lower tolerance and will definitely be weighted incorrectly especially if the infill is anything less than full Professional grade 3D Printers will be better and more accurate but will still likely be weighted slightly to one side Regardless of process though it would be possible to create a fair dice using 3D printing as the primary means of manufacturing and then weighing balancing and doing some post processing to even them out  I have tried to make an unfair die by putting 100 infill in the conner opposite to 6 5 and 4 When you float it it always comes with expected side up So with floating you really can check if somebody has tried to make it unfair The real-life tests have unfortunately shown my complete failure After 104 throws the average is 3.49 Even less than fair 3.5 It looks like the weight of plastic is too low to compete with hitting and rotation The next try could be to put something metallic into it during printing ",
        "comments": "Do you have any websites or stores that you would recommend for the cheaper and higher quality dice?In the real world no dice are perfectly fair But for a sufficiently loose/lenient definition of fair yeah sure 3D printed dice can be fair enough depending on what your criteria are.Your headline probably not is confusing since the title of the question asks if the dice will be fair but the body asks if it will be unfair.It's confusing that your title asks if the dice will be fair but the question itself asks if it'll be unfair People very often start their answer to a yes/no question with Yes or No but now it's not clear what those answers mean.Of course even if your manufactured die is structurally perfect in all ways and you roll it on a battered and scarred wooden table an edge hitting a groove will produce imperfections in the roll that wouldn't be present on an utterly smooth table All things are relative.@flith An imperfection in the table wouldn't systematically favour one roll over another so the rolls would still be fair Unpredictable imperfections are what makes a dice roll random the problem with imperfections in the dice is that they can have a predictable effect because they make it more likely to land in one orientation than another.I think your point about weight distribution could be quite important I guess using a denser infill or few top and bottom layers could help though.Random imperfections in either the table or the die are one thing but it would be all too easy to design and 3D print a die that favored one face over the others Such an imperfection could be made undetectable without destroying the die dynamically balancing it or doing a randomness study rolling the die many times and tracking the results I'd rather play whatever game I'm playing than mess around with that.There was another thread on SE http rpg.stackexchange.com/a/71038/4119 about how to easily test the fairness of a dice A top answer was to float it in water and poke it If it stops spinning with the same number up each time it's not fair wheras a fair die will tend to spin longer and stop with different numbers up http rpg.stackexchange.com/q/65206/4119 has more details.On a practical note if I were going to 3D-print a die to make it as fair as possible I'd probably make a prism-shaped die like this https images2.sw-cdn.net/product/picture/625x465_1016429_995425_1459316861.jpg and print it such that one of the ends ie the faces it's not meant to land on is the base during printing That would at least for the printer types I'm familiar with give you a better chance of a fair die because a lot of the non-uniformity tends to be in the vertical direction and/or with sloping faces and this way all important faces would be affected equally.I doubt this will work for any die with surfaces of varying area so be careful.I agree that creating a mold is the best thing to do with the 3Dprinter If you use ABS you could smooth the interior faces as desired w solvents after printing.@TomvanderZanden I believe I was clear in my question that I was concerned with the 3D printing process in general like how it produces from the ground up or some other process that could affect a die's balance If you must know I have access to a MakerBot Replicator which is what I would use for the dice but I still don't see exactly how the specific printer would make a difference Feel free to explain or direct me to the different printer processes and how the differences could affect the dice I would love to know. The 3D printing process does not exist Makerbot uses FDM which builds a model by layering molten plastic You could also use SLA/DLP which uses light to cure photosensitive resin to form your part You could use SLS which uses a laser to melt together metal or plastic particles to form your part LOM takes a piece of paper cuts out a slice of your model then glues these cutouts together to form the part Moreover even within a single process like FDM print settings would affect the outcome If you ask about 3D printing in general then the question is way too broad.Thanks for the testing Can I ask what printer/method you used to print the dice and what dice you tested?My printer is basically a MendelMax 2 and I was printed with PLA and I think a 0.4mm nozzle I definitely tried a d6 that's a hexagonal cylinder I was hoping it would be fairer since it only rolls around one axis but that didn't help I think I tried some other shapes too but I don't recall which.It looks like all the answers are talking about theory I have not seen any real tests So I have decided to put my real-life test of purposely unfair d6 die hitting and rolling plays much greater role than weight of some side.",

        "answers": " This looks like a heating or retraction issue I also have a Di3 and I encountered a similar problem a while ago I have found that leveling the bed very well and making sure the z-axis is aligned fixes most problems with this machine Re-calibrate your printer and try out a different slicer This link from the 3D Printer Wiki is very useful  I had a similar problem with my prusa i3 variant i built I found that this issue would decrease in occurance when retraction was disabled however would not completely disappear After much experimentation I found this to be a feed issue with the extruder In other words the filament was not being pushed hard enough to the teeth of the hobbed bolt to have enough traction to pull the filament down as fast and easy as the extruder would to pull the filament up during retraction Even without retraction enabled my extruder's drive gear teeth would not dig deep enough into the filament to pull a consistent amount of filament for the same x amount of distance per instances of a similar timeframe Essentially because retraction speeds are much faster than normal extrusion and there is not enough force required to retract compared to having to pull filament from the spool the retraction and extrusion settings would yield results that do not match actual expected filament travel distance My recommendation in your case 1 tighten your extuder idler so it puts more force on the filament What might appear tight to you does not necessarily mean is tight enough for consistent pull If yours uses the two long screws on springs for force maybe consider getting longer and tougher springs 2 Be aware of your extrusion steps/speed You don't want to grind your filament when retracting  Thanks to all the replies Whilst all of them may be valid in some scenarios my case seemed to have been a combination of things that relates to most of the replies here I had my spool holder on the side of the machine and I noticed some friction as the filament feeded over the arm on top of the printer into the extruder I sat and looked at this for a while and it seemed apparent that as the extruder moves up the angle of the filament over the guide arm on top changes to a more severe bend This may have been why it always battles to extrude nicely at a certain height and then maybe recoveres after that to an extent SO yes under extrusion may have been the issue I have now moved the filament to on top of the printer to feed straight down I have also slowed down the travel to about half of what it was 40 now was 60 I also dropped the infill speed a bit as that was also a mess most of the times So far I have had excellent results I am not sure if its the travel speed drop or the extruder feed that helped the most but I am a happy chappie again So far Thanks for all the input It really made me re-look at all of this from a different view ",

        "answers": " The proportion of production improvement is dependent on the size of the items being printed generally speaking Unfortunately it's variable enough to make a precise answer difficult Consider a single unit print I'll use my printer as an example Other printers may have similar sequences The print is begun and the bed has to heat up to temperature Once the set level is reached the print head(s also have to reach temperature Ignoring for the moment the print duration one then considers that the printer bed has to cool to release the print If you have ten items to print you gain nine times the above elapsed time That can be a substantial portion of production time On the flip side there isn't going to be much benefit in time from ten prints opposed to one You may lose some post-processing time if you have stringing between the items Directly related to quantity printing is yet another complication If you have a single print fail you've lost that time As an example one print may take 18 minutes Twelve minutes into the print you have a nozzle clog and have to abort the job That's an unfortunate loss With ten prints on the bed you are two hours into the print and have a failure Much worse loss of time and productivity Obviously one would prefer to have a properly fully working printer and be able to operate with the confidence that these failures won't appear Hobby grade printers can't provide that level of confidence but industrial/commercial grade printers should further improving the productivity time for printing multiple items on a bed If you have hot-swappable print beds maybe combined with the ability to pre-heat the incoming bed you gain time-wise I don't know enough of the commercial grade printers to suggest that such a feature exists My printer bed is attached with magnets and could be hot-swapped if I exercised care The bed would begin to cool quickly making a pre-heated plate all the more valuable I'll just print multiple items and hope for the best instead  Actually no It will take slightly more for each addition You also then have the point of failure where one gets knocked off and ruins all the prints The fastest way to print multiple objects is one at a time In fact slic3r lets you do just that with their sequential printing feature The reason is the time it takes to lift 0.5mm travel the few MM over to the next object lower the 0.5mm back down Repeat for inner shells outer shells infill all add time Doesn't seem like much till you do it 14,000 times In the case of your example it would be negligible In more complicated or well spaced prints its another story For extra extra fast look into loss PLA casting  Yes and no It depends For FDM printing the printing time mostly scales linearly with the number of objects However some printers have a minimum layer time whereby smaller layers are printed more slowly to ensure each layer takes at least this minimum time This gives the print enough time to cool Since the model shown in your example is quite small it's quite likely that it will hit the minimum layer time This means that printing one copy will take exactly as long as printing two copies which will take exactly as long as printing three copies until you hit the minimum layer time At this point adding more models will just add some constant number of minutes to your print time If the model is large enough for minimum layer time not to be a factor then printing the objects one at a time is generally faster because you save on travel moves between the layers of the two objects and also results in better quality print since the inter-object travel moves may leave behind stringing This only holds for FDM printing For DLP printing the printing time for a set of models only depends on their total height and thus the number of layers required since each layer requires the same amount of time regardless of the amount of material printed Thus the time for 1 2 3 n models is exactly the same There are many other types of printing process where the number of layers is much more important than the amount of material used such as binder jetting SLA and SLS Here there usually is some time cost involved for material printed but the main factor in the print time is the number of layers and for SLS the amount of time it takes for the build volume to cool down after each print which is quite significant  Printing multiple parts can save you time The issues pointed out by the other posters are all bang on but one factor that has been neglected is the time it takes you to clear the build plate and restart the print I found for smaller parts under 1 inch cube printing several parts at a time was more convenient and minimally faster The time saved came more from the fact that I could leave the printer for several hours and work on other tasks without having to babysit the printer waiting for it to finish each part I printed about 100-200 parts in this manner I did end up losing one batch when one part came loose and started causing problems but I found that was a small price to pay for being able to get a lot of other things done It'll come down to the criticality of your deadline on the parts If you're making parts for giggles and you don't need them done immediately then i'd say one at a time Less risk of failure less wasted material and the time isn't super critical If you're making parts for a prototype product that needs to be field tested in a few weeks then i'd go with small batches of multiple parts It'll give you more time to work on other things less releveling and you can check in once in a while to confirm it's okay usually without having to do anything assuming all is going well ",
        "comments": "What does loss PLA casting have to do with this How does it allow you to speed things up?You might add to your answer that the user is pretty much responsible for verifiying that the required X-Y clearance for the extruder head after a few objects have been printed is set properly And of course for those not using slic3r the advantage of printing everything at once is that we can walk away from the setup and come back when everything is done @TomvanderZanden They want to make a bunch 3d print and make a casting.That's not the right terminology then Lost PLA casting refers to a process where a PLA print is encased in plaster then burned/melted out and then molten metal poured into the void left The mold is then broken and a metal part extracted This doesn't help for making a bunch of parts since both the master part and mold are destroyed The idea to look in to silicone mold making and casting in resin is not a bad suggestion though but not really related to the question and there is no indication OP is looking to print that many copies of this part Yup thats why it was a foot note and not the answerIf other processes are acceptable Cast Urethane Molding would also be a really good option It's a good option for the 20-1000 part numbers Cheaper than injection molding or investment casting for those quantities Faster and cheaper by far compared to 3D printing suggested by Tom but didn't have the terms explicit stated)This depends Are you printing everything from one extruder or do you have multiple extruders working in parallel?Both The Beast with 4 and a maker",

        "answers": " Using The Burn Test to Identify Plastic Materials is one way From the link To initially determine whether a material is thermoplastic meltable or thermoset non-meltable type heat a metal or glass stirring rod until it glows red or orange to about 500\u00b0F 260\u00b0C and press it against the sample If the sample softens the material is a thermoplastic if it does not it's probably a thermoset Next hold the sample to the edge of a flame until it ignites If no flame is produced quickly hold the sample in the flame for about 10 seconds If the material burns note the color of the flame the nature of the smoke the presence of soot in the air and whether while burning the sample drips Next extinguish the flame and cautiously smell the fumes To identify the odor samples of known plastic samples for comparison can be most helpful Finally check your observations against the known characteristics of each plastic as shown in the table below Once you have made a tentative identification it is usually desirable to repeat the flame test once or twice to confirm the results of the original identification Remember that additives may affect results For example flame retardants can mask the polymer material's normal flame amp smoke burning characteristics However remember ABS and PLA aren't the only types of filament  ABS dissolves in acetone you could try clipping a small section and leave it in some acetone for a few minutes and if it begins to dissolve it's safe to assume that it's ABS if not then you'll know that it's not This won't confirm that it is PLA only whether it's ABS or not  I can identify filament type by smell of it when it is hot Touch it with solder or smth PLA emits a sweet smell resembling the burnt sugar ABS smells of chemicals PVC smells of chemicals too but this smell is very acrid and makes you sneeze PVC is toxic to burn and to print PC has a very peculiar smell If you bottle that smell into air freshener and call it flower meadow it will work PET You know this smell You experience it every time you unbox new gadgets HDPE and PP smell of church Of hot candles They are not easy to separate but an experienced person can do it by sound and feeling of snapping filament ",
        "comments": "I know but I bought PLA and ABS so it has to be one of the twoAny other ways without having to burn and smell plastic?ABS and PLA have different melting points and smell different when melting Maybe try melting little bits on a soldering iron or stove top The smell could give it away Just don't breath in the fumes it can be toxic also molten plastic particles in lungs arnt great eitherI'd recommend contacting the supplier.I just have the roll with no numbers works or anything on it.and how to I smell without breathing in the fumes No markings complicates matters Not very professional of the supplier Smelling without breathing in fumes just don't put your face directly over the fumes just hold it away from your face and sniff sniff the air if the smoke curls are going into your nose you are doing it wrongPlease do not post link-only answers The linked content might change or become unavailable rendering your answer useless While it is good to give external sources backing up your answer an answer should be self-contained and readable on its own Please at the very least provide a summary of the content at the link.Hi Noah I've proposed an edit to the title of your question because how to determine what type of filament isn't very clear as to your actual question it could also refer to a question about what type of filament to use for a particular purpose.@AndreHamman Thanks for the tips And the plastic came with the printer which is now off sale solidoodle v2 @TomvanderZanden Thanks!Great idea This is a lot safer and I know that it is PLA or ABS.I'm not sure how long it takes to dissolve or melt but I think it's pretty quick Certain types of nail polish removers contain acetone if you don't happen to have any laying around Good luck!It smells plasticly so is that abs?If you try to print with it or simply get a sample past the glass transition temperature you might find PLA tends to smell somewhat sweet.@HariGanti Well it definitely didn't smell sweetWell that seems to rule out PLA.@TomvanderZanden I have edited the answer to include the page content including the table A summary of the content would not really have provided sufficient How to info as essentially the table provides the required information so I have basically copied the entire page This could _potentially_ violate SE anti-plagiarism rules however ",

        "answers": " It's difficult to determine if the buckets are fully enclosed but I suspect that they are The enclosure into which the inserts are placed will provide some structural support 3D printed objects have relatively low torsion strength but a reasonable compression strength especially with high infill levels One could consider that the item placed into the insert will transmit force to the bucket but likely not compress to the point of destruction Allowing also that the forces on a swinging bucket centrifuge are downward or when in use outward the primary location of force will be the bottom of the insert you create It appears that the main function of the insert is to keep the tubes separated rather than to keep them supported Create your inserts but leave an open bottom Attach a suitably strong panel to the bottom of your created model with epoxy Another thing to consider in this project is the mode of failure What can go wrong The tubes in the insert should not explode but if they do is it merely cleaning up that follows I suppose one aspect of the inserts is to keep the tube walls in column to keep all forces linear to the tube cylinder rather than out of line It's easy to keep pennies in a stack under pressure but don't push on them edgewise You can and should perform a test on a 3D printed insert Make one that is relatively flimsy say a six-tube unit and spin it without tubes in place Test it prior to the spin for tube fit then test it after the spin If there is deformation you would not be able to insert the tubes after the spin  The primary printer I use is a makerbot and my gut is saying no 150G's of loading even in the XY axis seems pretty excessive for a part made on a Makerbot Also given that this is a rotational the weight and balance will need to be held to a pretty high tolerance otherwise you'll end up having an off-balance centrifuge which could damage a pretty expensive piece of equipment Admittedly I haven't checked the reliability for weight and balance of a part I've made for the loading condition you'd be going through but I'd be pretty hesitant about trying to run any FDM printed part under a loading case like that Makerbot or a high end printer given the speeds you'll be at If it's your only option though I'd suggest running your centrifuge at a very low speed first with the part in it and check it to see if you're picking up any transient vibration from it Increasing the speed as you feel comfortable My gut says that it'll fail before getting up to full speed from out of balance CofG of the part and the centrifuge starting to shake Sounds terrifyingly fun to try though IF you do try and run it,c an you post what happens I'd be very interested in hearing the results  It is my understanding that you are looking to print the insert not the gimble bucket The gimble bucket portion would be difficult and have high risk Fdm 3d printing looks like it would be a good solution for the inserts 3D prints have a high strength-to-weight ratio especially in compression and will easily hold their weight and 150g If the insert is properly drawn in cad with good tolerances the wall and floor of the gimbal bucket will help support the insert You can experiment with infills but i am sure anything upwards of 30 will do well In my experience with printing on a reprap fdm printer the same gcode and same fillament yeilds exactly the same weights If you switch fillament types have some extruder hangups or modify the gcode and have some small variation just hit the top of the heavy ones with a belt sander till they all measure the same Make sure to not sand the bottom because the distance of the sample to the bottom of the gimble bucket needs to be consistent ",
        "comments": "From what I have found in an image search the TX-200 buckets are closed at the bottom so adding a bottom plate should not even be necessary Also bear in mind that in a centrifuge the centrifugal force is increased gradually the part will not feel a shock of sudden 150G like when impacting a surface or being hit by something Gradual changes are way easier to cope with.150 sounded like a lot to me too but think about the masses involved If they're spinning something like blood that's about 1 gram per cc From the image they're looking at 50 ml tubes The tubes themselves probably contribute most of the weight and googling around suggests that they're maybe 15 grams So something like 15 150 2150g or about 2kg of force per tube I don't know whether that's okay or not but it's a lot less crazy sounding than the 150 G number.Low mass will certainly help but because it's a rotating mass if it's not perfectly balanced you're going to induce a pretty substantial wobble my quick math says this will be spinning 255 rads/s don't quote me on that though My big concern with that is if your part changes the CofG outside the spec of the machine it could self destruct Also 2kg isn't a force that's a mass 2 kg of mass exerts 19 N of force Regardless not huge but it'll come down to your geometry Definitely can be made strong enough with a 3D printed part.",

        "answers": " Some small start ups mainly 3d printing companies do in fact use 3D printed parts for the production printers they sell So at least in some instances 3D printed parts may be satisfactory for production products That being said other manufacturing methods such as injection molding currently have several advantages over 3D printing Injection Molding Pros It can produce parts of different sizes ranging from small to rather large like a plastic chair It provides superior inter-material bonding takes only a few seconds to produce a single part and can huge quantities of parts possibly millions in a single week Typically injection molding is often entirely automated with few moving parts Small details can be repeated well and parts can be made with many different polymers Cons Some geometries like a hollow sphere which can easily be produced with 3D printing are impossible to produce with injection molds Start up costs very be high A typical machine can cost hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars Mold cavities are costly to produce and require injection molding artifacts to be designed into the part like ejector pin notches Also the mold produces edge lines on the part where the two cavities meet Defect trouble shooting can be very complex and the ability to produce satisfactory parts can depend on heat flow which can be affected by things like the weather This can require climate control to eliminate to reduce waste in scrap parts due to warping and other malfunctions Sometimes advanced statistics are required to measure dimensions and detect developing problems too complex to deductively trouble shoot because they stem from a fluid thermodynamic issues Once 3D printing has time to develop further as injection molding has we may see it used more and more for production parts  TL:DR 3D printing is great for low quantities of items but terrible for large quantities of items This is a continuous scale and as your quantity grows the drawbacks of 3D printing become more pronounced In your situation you seem to be dancing in the nebulous zone where there isn't really a good answer as to which production method is better It's more of a question of price vs speed There are several factors that limit additive manufacturing technologies in this answer I'll just talk about FDM since you're asking about a plastic item from being practical in large scale manufacturing Time Compared to injection molding 3D printing takes a very long time An injection mold can make 72 plastic caps in 3 seconds While I don't have a source I would expect a similar item to take at least 5 minutes to be printed In order to produce an average of 24 caps/second you would need 7,200 3d printers working without down time That doesn't take into consideration Labor Every 3d printed object needs to be removed from the print bed by hand That requires a person to be there ready to remove the item It's possible to have automated print removal but for now I've yet to see it as a standard option on any machine An injection model machine can just pop the parts out into a box Even with the capability to remove the parts extra labor is still required for 3d printing because Quality Injection molded parts are as smooth as the mold they were made in While failures still exist even for molded items their relatively cheap production cost and very quick production time ensure that an occasional failure won't be problematic 3D printing on the other hand is still prone to variations in the final product For a few items it's sensible to hand finish the parts with filing sanding or other reductive manufacturing techniques but for many items this quickly become burdensome Also given the long production time compared to injection molding even 1 discarded product will result in a long time required to produce a replacement  Short Version 3d Printing is generally the most expensive method for building things mainly because it takes a long time to do Compared to other methods it's by far the slowest The few machines that can do parts quickly typically have very small build volumes so they're limited to only a few parts COmpared with injection molded parts you can make a dozen parts in a few seconds 3D Printing is closer to a few hours for one or two parts Unless there is a change in the process or the technology or philosophy of the process 3D printing will always be delegated to small runs Unspecific Answer You implied something in your post that you didn't explicitly ask for which I might be able to help with 3D printing is small scale Injection molding is large scale but you've glossed over the medium scale production methods that might be worth considering given your project If you're wanting to make small runs 20-500 units your time could be well spent looking into cast-urethane parts A mold will run around 200-500 depending on manufacturer complexity and size of the mold each mold is typically good for about 20 parts and then materials are roughly 20-30 for smaller sized parts The really nice thing about cast urethane is the material properties are very comparable to an injection molded part and the surface finish looks fantastic In my experience my workflow for a new part design is 3D print a few models to get from revision 0 to something you're confident should work cast urethane a few batches to get functional field testing completed and possibly even sell while the injection molding side gets set up Injection molding takes 5-6 weeks about as a minimum for first article 3D printing is a few hours and cast urethane is 2-3 weeks tops less if you pay a bit more edit Forgot to mention that by using cast urethane as an intermediate you still have the flexibility to change your design without resulting in huge mold redesign costs Because the mold is only good for about 20 parts modifying you can modify your part and update without incurring huge re-molding costs ",
        "comments": "Also for some injection molds they can be very large in general like 10 wide x 15 long x 12 feet high and in comparison to the part they produce.Also I have seen injection mold producing around 70 million parts a year run 24/7 days a week until break down for several weeks with around 2-3 yield in actuality though they reported around 1 cause they lie So that is about 1 million scrap parts I think this is a good estimate on the yield injection molds can obtain here in the states China and west/northern Europe probably below 1 I like this answer as it directly addresses the fact that even though everyone says other methods should be cheaper my experience directly counters that I'm curious about the cast urethane though You said they're only good for 20 parts does it then break down and a new mold is needed If so that's 500 20 25 per part just for the mold I'll look further into this and try to get some quotes thanks.Definitely get a quote pricing could vary a great deal depending on who you're talking to the process they use and of course part complexity It's been my experience that a mold is good for about 20 parts though if it's a simple enough part I think they could last for more runs Whatever the number is the mold is effectively useless at that point and it's discarded so a new mold would have to be made then The molds are typically made from silicone so they're much easier to damage and the constant pulling of the part tears them up as I understand it.Equating filament cost to total cost is a shortcut to going out of business Printer maintenance costs money power to feed the printer costs money space the printer takes up in house or shop costs money other work the printer could be doing is lost money while printer is occupied It's a trick going from a hobby mindset where that's all free to actually not bleeding money in a business setting a trick many would-be businesses don't manage well.@Ecnerwal Yes that's true but that's why I included the cost that I was quoted for someone else to 3D print it which is 4x the filament cost That is still less than the injection molding cost per piece which is why I thought it odd.In your particular example unless you can find a place to do the molds for less the break-even is a bit further out once it comes it comes on pretty strong though Without bothering to work it to the finest detail somewhere before 650 is break-even assuming per piece cost remains at 4 and then the more you need the less it costs Whether the other 3D printing operation has got their pricing model correct is unknown I suppose you could order 100 parts and see if they suddenly want to renegotiate after printing a few dozen but you'd likely prefer to run your own printer instead See also 3D printed mold techniques for long and short term usage https 3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3178/3d-printed-mold-techniques-for-long-and-short-term-usage)I meaned scrap so yield 100The moulds may only last 20 parts but the master used to cast the mould should be good for casting more than one mould.",

        "answers": " 50\u00b0C is hot for you PLA's glass transition temperature is 65\u00b0C A car in the mid-day sun can get very hot indeed As to the question of stronger if the part is designed to be strong enough for its use in PLA it will be no better in stronger ABS If the PLA part will be more precise and less warped that may well make it better for its use Other than a widespread community dedication to self-replication or mostly self-replicating with some metal parts there's plenty of arguments for making most printer parts out of machined metal for that matter much stronger than ABS or PLA Brittleness likewise might matter if you were planning to drop the printer but should not matter in use if the part is designed for the forces it will see in the material it's designed for Looking at older technology many machine tools are made of cast iron which is quite brittle rather than steel which can be less brittle depending on how it's processed If the part is designed for the job and used/handled in a reasonable way brittle is not an inherently bad thing and a thin steel part that flexes is a worse thing than a thick cast iron part that flexes less As for withstand the elements that appears to be a reference to outdoor use where PLA will break down but if you are not leaving your printer out in the rain which will be bad for many other parts unless you do a lot of engineering to protect them that should be of little concern  To answer the main question Is ABS better for structural parts of a 3D printer as opposed to PLA The answer unfortunately is it depends ABS has lower yield and ultimate strengths compared to PLA This means that at room temperatures ABS is weaker than PLA However the difference between yield and ultimate for ABS is much larger than PLA meaning that ABS parts will deform noticeably so before breaking This can be a good thing If your ABS part is highly loaded you may want to be able to inspect it for overloading The plastic deformation that occurs in ABS may be sufficient for you to identify and modify your parts before a catastrophic failure With PLA though since the two strengths are quite close your part would more than likely fail completely without any warning or deformation before it So in terms of strength it's a design consideration Would you rather have a slightly weaker part that shows signs of load failure or is a catastrophic failure acceptable There are use cases where either may be better As Ecnerwal pointed out PLA has a lower Tg glass transition temperature compared to ABS If your printed parts are going on a 3D printer and aren't sufficiently isolated from the hot parts print bed or extruder then you may end up having some localized deformation That being said the extruder is generally pretty localized and likely won't cause you too many issues assuming you're using any of the already available 3D printer designs out there same for the print bed However by the sounds of it your room temperature is a fair bit higher than here in North America by a factor of almost 2 This could cause you some issues if you're printing parts in the high heat with PLA Your best option would be ABS but even with it's higher Tg roughly 90C if I remember correctly you may still run into issues The warping and shrinkage issues mentioned in the question seem to be more about parts being built by a 3D printer Once the parts are built warpage and shrinkage are essentially a non-issue unless you've heated parts back to within their melting temperatures Depending on where you're getting your plastic parts there may be a third option By the sounds of it you're looking at building your own printer You may be able to get the STL files of the printed parts you need and then have someone print them for you in a stronger material such as Nylon Assuming alternative materials aren't an option I would personally suggest going with ABS for your use case My reasoning is purely due to the potential operating temperatures While 50C is below the Tg for PLA it's getting very close  To answer your question ABS is better than PLA for parts however I wouldn't use ABS for that I would use PETG for structural parts PETG is more durable than ABS or PLA PETG is more flexible than PLA and it not brittle like ABS What makes PETG so good is the G G stands for Glycol this is added to prevent the material from crystallizing when over heated While some companies say it is Food Grade you really need to be careful as note every factory produce it the same When I started printing I only used ABS I thought it was better because it was stronger than PLA so I just put up with the smell of ABS It wasn't until I bought my second printer that I found out about PETG They guy that makes my printer used to work in the plastics industry so he gave me some info on the filaments on the market Now I use PLA and PETG PLA for testing and playing with different models and PETG for anything I want to last or will be used in hot environments like in the car Printing with PETG is very easy a lot easier than ABS It sticks to the bed very well I still use Glue stick though and no smell Temp depends on your printer I use an ExtraBot I run the Extruder at 220\u00b0C and the glass bed at 80\u00b0C There are a lot of write ups on PETG many different settings/temps they recommend Honestly watch while you print Start off at 220\u00b0C and if you see bubbles drop the temp in increments if you see it not sticking to the bed or the nozzle is clogging up increase the temp ",

        "body": " I am using a Prusa i3 MK2 to do a print in ASA and I'm having a problem where on the second layer the plastic runs into lines across the direction the head travels It looks like the plastic is being repelled by the previous layer and running together due to surface tension but I may be wrong about this I thought I had managed to solve this problem previously by reducing the temperature to 230\u00b0C 1 st layer 225\u00b0C other layers but having changed some of the other settings this is no longer solving the problem I have tried reducing the temperature as low as 215\u00b0C 210\u00b0C and this is still happening Here is a photograph of the first and second layers The direction of head travel for the first layer was bottom left lt top right and for the second layer top left lt bottom right The settings were based on the standard Prusa i3 MK2 Slic3r settings bundle for ABS filament with a 0.05&nbsp;mm layer height modified as follows print temperature reduced to 230\u00b0C 225\u00b0C fan speed increased slightly to 15 as on 10 the fan doesn't start layer height for first 14 layers 0.2&nbsp;mm extrusion widths set to Slic3r defaults various print speeds reduced mainly the travel speed number of top and bottom layers reduced because of the increased layer height The reason for increasing the layer height for the first 14 layers is that the print is a piece of mixed raised text and braille lettering intended to be inset into a larger sign I want fine detail for the top layers with the lettering but high speed for the lower layers that are more structural I am inserting an M600 change filament manually into the G-Code file at the point where the lettering starts I have so far managed to produce one successful print see the image below The reason I am still playing with the settings is that the good print wasn't in high enough quality and there was some slight stringing between letters The good print was based on a 0.1&nbsp;mm layer height for the lettering modified to 0.15&nbsp;mm for the lower layers with a temperature of 230\u00b0C 225\u00b0C ",

        "answers": " Yes measures which decrease the chance of a fire are a good idea In a DIY project such a fuse is indeed a good idea I use a printer/software/firmware package which monitors the temperature and fails open removing current if readings are out of range however there is also hardware protection a thermal snap switch just in case the other precautions fail  Whether you should use a thermal fuse or not depends on what other safety measures you've taken You can't look at the safety features of a printer in isolation you need to look at what other measures are in place The main fire hazard in printers is unfortunately still the fact that some manufacturers use underrated connectors on their boards and that some users put bare wires in screw terminals or use inadequate torque when tightening terminals As the wire works itself loose it starts arcing and burning the connector A thermal fuse does not help in this situation unless you place thermal fuses near all of the connectors which is impractical Instead Properly tighten screw terminals check them and consider using proper wire termination crimp lugs Use strain relief on wires Make sure wires don't rub against anything and guide them so they do not bend in a tight radius Since the extruder or print bed is constantly moving those wires are subject to fatigue Make sure connectors especially those for the heated bed are rated for the current running through them and solder wires directly to the board if necessary Using a regular fuse may protect against wires shorting against each other should their insulation be damaged Fuses are usually already integrated into the main board Most firmwares include some variant of thermal runaway protection a feature that monitors the heaters and shuts the printer down if it notices something gone wrong This protects against The thermistor coming loose/reading incorrect values/etc but not against Bugs in the firmware itself Failure of the MOSFET Most printers use MOSFETs to switch power to the heating element Unfortunately when MOSFETs fail they usually fail closed i.e conducting This means that even if the firmware detects something has gone wrong it won't be able to do anything about it Solid State Relays TRIACs can fail in the same way To protect against this mounting a thermal fuse or resettable bimetallic switch on the heated bed may be a good idea However thermal fuses with ratings up to the operating temperature of a hotend do not appear to be available so this is not an option Attaching the fuse physically to the part it is monitoring is the most reliable but for instance with the hotend if you wanted to protect it all this might not be feasible to the high temperatures involved so you'd have to settle with monitoring the air temperature close by Also consider thermal balancing A thermal fuse is unnecessary if the component can not overheat to begin with For instance most MK2 heated beds struggle getting up to even 100C so even with a shorted MOSFET they present no danger However if you have a powerful high wattage mains-powered heated bed you should definitely install thermal protection E3D supplies their hot ends with 25W 30W and 40W heaters The 25W heater is the safer choice since it limits the maximum temperature the hot end can get to while with the 40W heater you can reach higher temperatures and reach them faster Barring a very unlikely scenario in which simultaneously 1 the power supply fails and starts supplying excessive voltage and 2 the MOSFET and/or firmware fails a heater that is sized appropriately to the load it is driving can never pose any danger I don't think it's common to install thermal fuses on steppers stepper drives or the power supply which should have its own protection For every possible location to place a thermal fuse you can probably think up a failure mode in which that fuse would save the day but at a certain point it just becomes overkill The stepper drivers would likely burn out well before the steppers would get hot enough to pose a threat and overheating of the stepper driver would probably violently destroy it but afterwards it should not pose any threat Axial v.s radial does not matter just use whatever is convenient for your situation Note that some bimetallic switches short one of the leads to the metal case when tripped which poses a danger especially with mains-powered heaters  IMHO if you seek hands-off unattended fire safety you'd be looking at something a bit more specific to that job than measuring or limiting the temperature of printer components That's great as far as it goes when it works but it's not anything like a complete solution Cutting off the electrical supply won't put out a fire that has progressed to burning plastic etc Reasonable over-current protection for a start Contain the printer inside a metal cabinet or cementboard-lined closet a non-flammable enclosure add a heat and/or smoke detector in the top of that enclosure and rig that to not only cut off power to the printer but given things have gone far enough wrong to set that off also set off an extinguishing means the effectiveness of which will be enhanced by an enclosure A little bit of looking finds for predictably high prices sorry that there are indeed fire extinguishers with a sprinker-head valve attached for this type of spot suppression job that would cover the set off an extinguisher part of the job without need of any power You'd still want a heat detector that would shut off the electrical supply to the printer in the event of abnormally high temperatures in the enclosure and you might want a smoke detector doing the same This is probably representative of about 0 of actual installations at present but it would be a good way to reduce the risk in the event of a serious malfunction Presumably the current distribution of risk looks a lot like the maker stating the recommendation is when printing to watch the 3D

        "answers": " I've had great success printing with HIPS high-impact polystyrene as a support for both PLA and ABS Most sites recommend it for use with ABS because the materials melt at similar temperatures and work best with heated beds but I've had good luck using it as a support material with PLA on a bed at 60\u00b0C It doesn't stick as well to PLA as it does to ABS so supports tend to peel away very readily The downside is that if you need the support to anchor your print at all it doesn\u2019t really stick well enough to accomplish this task For that you must pair HIPS with ABS When you print with ABS or have complicated interwoven support structures HIPS can be dissolved with D-limonene a citrus based cleaner sold under various names like Citrisolv others exist or with dipentene a mixture of L and D-limonene that doesn't smell as pleasant Regarding cost I've found HIPS to be slightly more expensive than PLA/ABS but only 1.5x the cost not 4x like PVA Additionally it isn't hydroscopic in the same way as PVA so it lasts longer out of the package Since you're using it as support you also tend to use far less filament than you do for the main print sparse support structures as opposed to solid print structures Water-soluble alternatives There are a few proprietary blends of polymers sold by the big commercial printer manufacturers 3DSystems Stratasys that only work in their machines these are generally soluble in basic solutions water sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate These are usually very expensive and you'd have to rewind the filament on a spool as they come in cartridges made for specific printers You'd also have to experiment with the right build conditions and solution blends to remove the material afterward Airwolf has a support material called Hydrofill that purports to be soluble in plain water I'm not sure how this is different from standard PVA though I assume it is different Hopefully more companies will work on developing water-soluble options to help us keep the 3D printing world full of renewable less-environmentally-harmful options for filaments both print and support ",

        "answers": " That are certainly trade-offs between the two options I think main trade-off between the two options you described would be visual details vs configurability With a scanned design you have the ability to capture all the visual details that are in your hand crafted model Those same details might require more effort than you are willing to put into a CAD design like window and door detail and other architectural accents The big disadvantage of a scanned model it that it would not be parametric so you can't fiddle with design details like adjusting the width or spacing of the windows the position of a door or external approach stairs etc Also you could play with the external skins/finishes and play with how wood looked as compared to concrete of brick Another advantage of a CAD model would be that you would not be able to break out components and print them separately because of print volume issues or to be able to print in different colors My personal preference would be to create a 3D Model using a CAD package The limitation on this would be that it might not have the same level of detail but it would be much more flexible You could probably create the base design pretty easily either from the architectural drawings or by deconstructing the hand crafted model The model was probably built from pieces much the same way a 3D CAD model is created Here is a good example of how to do that In the example they create a pretty detailed house design in Sketchup in 35 min by starting with scans of the architectural drawings There are quite a few other similar videos so you should look for the one that fits you best ",

        "answers": " TL;DR The settings that you seem to need can be found here Print One At a time settings CURA You actually can Providing that none of your object is too tall taller than the Gantry clearance Also the objects cannot be too close from each other when you activate the option and move objects on the bed you see a gray box around them showing this limit The reason you cannot use it at the moment is probably because you didn't filled the printer head size parameters Menu Machine Machine Settings You will have to measure them but on mine Australian clone of the i3 I use those values and it works fine Head size toward X min 30 Head size toward Y min 70 Head size toward X max 60 Head size toward Y max 50 Printer gantry height 35 Those are conservative values a little bigger than the actual values It means I'm losing a little bed space but I prefer that to the risk of having the print head knocking out previous prints if one of the measurements is too low o PS The option will automatically disable itself if some object dimension are too big to avoid collisions To be fair the rest of the thread is people debating whether you can successfully achieve sequential printing or not with the Wanhao Duplicator I3 However the setting above seem to be the settings that you are looking for Apart from Head size toward X max they also correlate pretty much to the settings that you have already determined As the poster notes their settings are somewhat on the conservative side which would explain the difference Extra detail If this is so that you can achieve sequential printing 1 then this may not be suitable for your printer unfortunately Sequential printing works best for printers with a long nozzle with nothing fans X-axis gantry etc around it for example a delta printer with a low hanging nozzle would be ideal Your printer type has a wide head with attachments as well as an X-axis gantry and so the clearance is less than that of an ideal delta See WanHao Duplicator i3 Printer Head Size Settings for Cura for more details If you wish to go ahead and still try it then from the same link The way to measure is lower the nozzle to the bed Then measure the space taken up around the nozzle by the heater block fans mounting the motor and finally the distance between the X axis rods and the bed WHEN the nozzle is touching the bed That gives you some idea of the clearance you have where an ALREADY printed object can exist on the bed and NOT get slammed into the gantry or moving head when printing a second sequential part Just a visual with a moving bed printer and it's not promising Not impossible but in a 200mm square build area you might really only get 4 objects at a time in the 4 quadrants Even that is height limited because the gantry will slam into it at a certain height Maybe some weird staggering pattern Also of use for obtaining your own measurements from Ultimaker Cura 14.07 Printer Head Size If I'm not mistaken all measurements are taken from the nozzle tip So for the first one measure the size of your head from the nozzle tip towards the direction in X to where your machine homes and There's a tooltip when you mouse over these settings which describes what they mean Gantry height is the vertical clearance between the build plate and your x-y gantry on the Ultimaker these are the 6mm shafts which hold the head If you print two objects one after another then the first object must be shorter in height than the gantry height Otherwise the gantry would crash into the first part while printing the second part In more detail paying attention to the placing of the objects can aid with any issues that you have with a low gantry If you place multiple parts in a diagonal line across the build-plate so the gantry and head never intersects earlier parts after printing them you can set the gantry height to an artificially high value to ignore it without problems I place pieces along a diagonal from right-front to left-rear to avoid conflict when the head homes after finishing the print I can fit 3 to 4 small but tall pieces on the build plate that way for sequential printing The purpose of these Printer head size settings is to enable Cura to determine the order in which the objects are printed none of those settings are important as long as you only print one STL file at a time It's when you want to print multiple objects one at a time that these numbers have a purpose it allows Cura to figure out which order to print them in and if it can do them one at a time or if it has to print them all at once Footnote 1 Sequential Printing is where one object is completely printed before moving on to the next object instead of the usual method of printing all objects simultaneously one layer at a time This method can give superior quality prints but not always The main advantage appears to be reduced stringing of filament between objects and a cleaner surface finish due to reduced print head movement between objects The process is detailed in Multi-part printing ",

        "answers": " Servos do have several advantages but they are more expensive and more difficult to control Generally a servo motor is a DC motor but with an encoder to provide position feedback A circuit can be a computer then compares the actual position from the encoder against the commanded position and uses the error to determine how much power to put to the motor usually by PWM Some of the advantages of servos The encoders on the motor often have thousands of counts per revolution so they are accurate They are a great choice for controlling a large mass When beginning a motion the control loop can detect that more power is required when the encoder does not respond as fast as expected thus putting more power to the motor This will them automatically reduce as the motor reaches speed and no longer needs the acceleration torque Also the servo loop can also apply reverse torque when trying to slow down the large mass to limit overshot Some of the disadvantages of servos The DC Motors used for servos reach peak power at thousands of RPM That means to use them on a printer you will need to gear them down This adds to the expense You need electronics to PWM the power to the DC Motor and to close the servo loop usually at least 1&nbsp;KHz This can require a lot of the CPU Probably would be more than a Melzi could do since it is already maxed out The servo loop tuning can cause the motor to buzz when it is holding position on an unloaded axis This could cause print issues I know you have likely seen cheap servos out there often called hobby servos These are often used in RC These use a creative trick that allows them to use a cheap potentiometer to create an inexpensive control loop The limit to this trick is that it CAN NOT rotate a full 360 thus it CAN NOT run a continuous axis Yes I know there are hobby servos out there that are called continuous rotation servos but they do that by disconnecting the potentiometer In that case they are no longer servos This is just a way to use the same control interface to control a standard DC motor and the motors are not accurate Stepper motors on the other hand Are really cheap Don't require complicated drive circuits or control loops Love to hold position without a load Their downside is that their rotational accuracy is limited by the physical poles of the motor This can be improved using micro-stepping but there are limits Also it is difficult often impractical to determine if the motor missed a step That can usually be handled by just making sure that the load on the motor is always well below the step torque This often involves managing the motor acceleration In summary servos are great for some applications but for low cost situations like 3D printing steppers are hard to beat It is likely servos needed for milling CNCs because the cutting head is much more massive than an extruder or laser and the servo control loop is needed to provide accurate motion for the higher mass  Servo is best when you primarily provide an exact position to go to sounds like a human arm isn't it However number of positions is sometimes overwhelming Think about a painting is it easier to draw point by point or just throwing the pencil relatively with instincts That is why you need less computing when using stepper motors because they just step locally without worrying about the overall painting Having said that it is more costly for a stepper motor to travel far distances because it has to think about its every step  Servo for spindle to control rotation speed of cutting bit Stepper to control movement and tool position All CNC machines  The main reason why stepper motors are used is their low price Small stepper motors NEMA 17 and smaller are powerful enough for 3D printers because the mass is so small These motors generally require a maximum of 2 amps of current 2 amps is small enough that control chips with all the circuitry and drive electronics can be manufactured as an integrated unit The most common chips in 3D printers are the Allegro line of chips Since they are so common the price per chip is extremely low Servo motors could have a similar fully integrated chip but the issue is servos need to be tuned for their specific application A servo needs to be tuned separately for each axis of each model of a 3D printer or other CNC device This makes servos much more difficult to use for hobbyists in particular If a servo is not tuned properly it could oscillate dramatically or respond to inputs too slowly The interface for tuning would probably be a serial interface which would increase the cost and complexity dramatically Additionally servo motors require an encoder of some type Often it is an optical encoder but there are also magnetic encoders and capacitive encoders The cost of the encoder is essentially constant no matter how powerful the motor is so when you have a small motor the cost of the encoder is significant High resolution magnetic encoders are 3 each in bulk That would add a lot of cost to the motor not including the other more expensive drive electronics Optical encoders can be cheaper I'm not sure of the specific pricing on those Ignoring cost servo motors with high resolution encoders would definitely be better for 3D printers I think we will likely see some higher end consumer printers with servos come onto the market soon Servos would eliminate missed steps potentially increase acceleration and maximum speed depending on the size and would reduce vibrations if properly tuned The answer given by markshancock brings up good points too but I wanted to elaborate on the cost issue  The basic difference between a traditional stepper and a servo-based system is the type of motor and how it is controlled Steppers typically use 50 to 100 pole brushless motors while typical servo motors have only 4 to 12 poles ",

host the log constantly shows the name of my printer's manufacturer and I'm unable to execute anything Is there any workaround to it?@OjasviSrivastava Can you post the log file contents or a relevent excerpt in your question Also clarify in your question that you are using Repetier Host and state exactly what happens and what you are doing or trying to do The more information you provide then the more accurately someone will be able to address the issue that you are experiencing.I've added a screenshot I've never really done this before so let me know if you need any more details Is it important to install Arduino IDE before repetier host I did it in the other order.@OjasviSrivastava No the installation order will not matter You probably need to rebuild the firmware I would guess but I am not 100 sure It might be a good idea to contact the vendor to see what they recommend before overwriting their code assuming that the control board came pre-programmed WRT the log instead of a screen shot it would be better to copy and past the actual text from the log if possible as thereafter it is easier to copy or search whereas the text in a screenshot is neither copiable nor searchable or provide both the text and screenshot.well the vendor is asking me to renew the contract which will cost me a lot He'll provide me any support only after I do that If I could only tweak the relevant parameters delta radius rod length etc without rebuilding the entire firmware that'd be great PS I've pasted the log in the question Hope that helps@OjasviSrivastava If you have to get around the licensing then it sounds like you could/should recompile the firmware or use some other firmware i.e Marlin However wait to see what other people suggest Can you edit your question to state the actual brand/make/model of the printer BTW I found this video 18 Calibration https www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuEhQU8vGZk extremely useful for configuring Marlin.so there isn't any way to edit the current configuration.h file I'll wait for some time for an answer to this Alternately is there any way to view the file so that i can use most of the values and change only the relevant ones while compiling a new firmware Also is Marlin better than Repetier?@OjasviSrivastava be aware that there is some risk burning custom firmware I know of one person that tried this and was unable to print for quite some time If you cannot tolerate the down time I recommend that you consider either buying a second controller card they are often VERY cheap on ebay if your printer is using a generic RAMPS/Melzi board or get an external programmer that connects to the ISP connector so that you can first make a copy the firmware/fuse settings so you can restore your printer controller to its current state if things do not go well.@markshancock can you please elaborate the two methods you've stated here I have zero idea about all this Any tutorial link would be helpful too So you're saying that a firmware can only be copied to another controller card external programmer I was wondering if there is any way to extract the firmware from the current board as a workable file that I can tweak in Arduino IDE So far I've only been able to extract EEPROM value using Repetier host But for all I know those values are incorrect as my printer is likely reading those values following the unfortunate reboot@OjasviSrivastava Sorry I meant to reply last night There is no way of extracting the code from an Arduino and then modifying it You need the original source code files See Is there any way to download a sketch from an Arduino https arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/179/is-there-any-way-to-download-a-sketch-from-an-arduino OK you can obtain the machine code but unless you are an expert or guru modifying it is impossible.@OjasviSrivastava There really isn't much risk in uploading new firmware The only risk which I guess Mark is referring to is that you may/will not have the correct firmware settings for your make of printer and therefore the printer may not work correctly until you get the firmware settings correct So in that respect it is a good idea to buy a secondary Arduino Mega and RAMPS1.4 board to play with for just 10 Chinese clones work just fine But as you say that your board already has bad settings then you haven't much to lose by uploading new firmware to it except the warranty.@OjasviSrivastava This article https www.hackster.io/rayburne/avr-firmware-duplicator-115d8f explains how to use an AVR programmer to backup your existing firmware so in theory you can always get back to your original code As Greenonline mentioned this is a binary backup and is not intended to be modified Trying to reverse-engineer modifiable code from the binary code on the Arduino is not realistic.@OjasviSrivastava As comments may be deleted at any time I have moved the pertinent information from those comments into my answer as footnotes so that the information is not lost Please see my updated answer.@markshancock As comments especially extended discussions such as this may be deleted at any time it might be wise to post the information contained in your comments into an answer so that the information is not lost Also it would centralise the information and save others having to trawl through a lot of comments @Greenonline I've edited the question with a picture of my printer's control board Please let me know how to proceed My printer is not under warranty otherwise the vendor would've taken care of everything.The reason that you have no RAMPS board is that on your board the RAMPS and the Arduino circuitry are merged into one Any new controller would work as they all run the same firmware There are many to choose from As you are just experimenting and reverse engineering at this stage I personally would buy a cheap Chinese Arduino Mega 2560 and RAMPS board on eBay for only 10 if you buy them separately don't get a combination deal to test your settings Once you are happy with those settings then you can spend more money on a better board should you feel that you need it.",

answer from the suppliers Hi Good Day thanks for your contact we use M3 bolts T-nuts i suppose the problem is you don't have T-nuts right T-nuts is used for 2020 extrusion with warm regards james I replied for a clarification of the length required Many thanks for the reply I have two types of 2020 extrusion with differing profiles one that takes T-Nuts and one that takes regular hexagonal M5 nuts For the T-nut extrusion I have both M3 and M5 T-nuts However the second type of 2020 extrusion takes regular M5 nuts Regular M3 nuts will not stay in place unless I can find some M3 nuts with a larger outer diameter greater than 7 mm With respect to the M3 bolts what are the lengths required Are two lengths used One length to secure the endstop switch and holder to the 2020 extrusion and then another length to secure the remaining three holes Looking at the diagram in your build guide it seems as if only one bolt is used to secure the endstop switch and holder to the frame is that correct Are any other bolts used to secure the PCB mounted switch the the endstop holders I thank you in advance Best regards I followed this up with a second email Hi again James Following on from my previous reply Firstly I have found that flanged M3 nuts will work perfectly in the extrusion that will not accept T-Nuts Secondly what I really am looking for is a list of the lengths and dimensions of the bolts used throughout the Sintron build In particular the endstop bolts Rather than having to iteratively deduce each bolt a list of the bolts used would be very handy I thank you again in advance for your kind consideration Best regards I received a second reply from Sintron Hello Friend for endstop it's M3*8mm i am collecting the list of them for you soon thanks james  For the M3 t-nuts could you use this printed solution You are just attaching a PCB so it you wouldn't need that much strength Another excuse to use your 3D printer ",
        "comments": "Note I don't have a Kossel so no guarantee the lists are complete Anyway it is a kit so the parts you need is a bit flexible I built a Tronxy X3 kit and the parts supplied were mostly complete but several build steps called out parts that weren't in the kit I am glad I have a pretty good selection of screws and nuts in my shop.Many many thanks but unfortunately they are not for the Sintron kossel I have seen those links see my confused blog Kossel 3D Printer https gr33nonline.wordpress.com/2017/04/28/kossel-3d-printer However the Sintron Kossel whilst having many common features with other Kossels is a bit of a particular/peculiar beast W.R.T the endstop holders the Sintron uses the PCB mounted types with four holes and not the simple barebones mechanical switches with two holes that the TriDPrinting/Google docs uses I'll update my question to be clearer.@Greenonline Well that is complicated I'll see what I can find and add it to my answer.As a friend of mine said sounds like a lot of data but no useful information I added some info on the t-nuts and screws to my answer above that may help This is another solution http www.ebay.com/itm/2830-PC-METRIC-BOLT-NUT-WASHER-LOCK-WASHER-ASSORTMENT-KIT-W-36-HOLE-BIN/272649166675 that might work.@markshancock The particular 2020 aluminium extrusion which I am using will not accept regular T-Nuts although I am not sure about the slim half T-Nuts See Fat hexagonal M3 nuts with outer diameter greater than 6 mm https engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/15628/fat-hexagonal-m3-nuts-with-outer-diameter-greater-than-6-mm Flanged hex M3 nuts seems to be the way to go.@markshancock I love the idea of 2830 pieces of fasteners Unfortunately upon further thought flanged hex M3 nuts aren't a solution after all They would have no purchase on the sides of the slot and would spin hopelessly upon being tightened Seems like I will have to get standard extrusion that will accept T-nuts and use the non-European extrusion for a different set of printed parts that use M5 nuts.The Sintron build manual clearly states what fastener is used for each location Every picture has the size and length on it.For the endstops you're just going to have to measure what you have for parts and buy as needed I'm not even sure how they use all 4 holes as it looks like 2 of them may block the connection.Also many wire cutters/crimpers have bolt cutters built-in near the hinge that are more than capable of cutting M3 screws http a.co/dew90MR so you could just buy the longest length you can find that are fully threaded and cover everything below.I am really surprised you are having so much challenge with the t-nuts fitting the extrusion The extrusion you have must have an non-standard profile If you buy more 2020 from eBay I recommend you buy the t-nuts as part of the set.Here is the offering on eBay http www.ebay.de/itm/Sintron-2020-Openbeam-Aluminum-Extrusion-Kit-for-3D-Drucker-mini-Kossel-Rostock 131521171318 where I got the profile I dislike linking eBay offerings since they are temporary I'm including it separately so I can deleted it later if the link goes dead.@markshancock I bought the 2020 in Bangkok 6 meters for 20 See Fat hexagonal M3 nuts with outer diameter greater than 6 mm https engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/15628/fat-hexagonal-m3-nuts-with-outer-diameter-greater-than-6-mm for a photo@tjb1 Unfortunately the SIntron build manual does not state it clearly for the endstops Blocking the connection yes it is a pretty crappy printed kit to be honest FolgerTech is superior although I only paid 20 for the PLA parts and 20 for the 2020 aluminium Cutting bolts to length with wire cutters tends to damage the thread of bolt A Dremel will do though I suppose but I would prefer in order to keep costs to a minimum to order the correct length of bolts as the longer bolts cost more Not by much I know but I'm building these for people on extremely tight budgets.@tjb1 Hmmm yes upon reflection the manual does clearly state that M3 bolts are used for the frame assembly If only I had read the manual before buying the 2020 that only accepts M5 hex nuts I would not be in such a pickle I must admit I might have to use this set of 2020 extrusions with another part set that does use M5 and get a new set of lengths of European Standard 2020 cut for use with the Sintron kit.Have you tried to buy your extrusion from Misumi I'm not sure if they ship to the UK but they do have a European site and it is fairly cheap from them cut to whatever size you want.@tjb1 I am in Bangkok I looked at Misumi about a month ago but aluminium in Thailand is about 30-50 the price of US/Europe although that would explain why you don't always get quite the right specification You may want to simply make square nuts to suit your extrusion with flat stock a saw a drill and an M3 tap That's what I'd do anyway if I couldn't find ones to purchase.That is a good tip but I need them principally along with other reasons for attaching the extrusions to the vertices so they need to be strong and in metal really But why can't you use M5 for the other locations Note Use of But is a homage to your English Post https ell.stackexchange.com/questions/52239/why-do-people-incorrectly-begin-a-sentence-with-the-word-but) All of the holes in the Sintron printed parts are M3 I considered reaming the holes to make them M5 but i don't want to lower the integrity of the parts i.e weaken them nor have slightly misaligned screw holes etc.Did you buy them or print them your self I could see not wanting to redrill the holes in a printed part as it you could cut into the infill but certainly they couldn't be that difficult to change the design to use M5 I can't imagine the margins around the holes would be thin enough to compromise the part They can't be carrying that much load.I ordered them from eBay BTW this is a good answer but it answers the wrong question That is to say that it doesn't provide a Parts List for the Sintron which is what I am looking for here but it does provide a solution to the big fat nut that I'm looking for on SE.Engineering So you should post this answer as an answer or have it migrated to my question on SE.Engineering Fat hexagonal M3 nuts with outer diameter greater than 6 mm Fat hexagonal M3 nuts with outer diameter greater than 6 mm)@Greenonline I will add the comment to you engineering post but IMHO it is providing you with a different option for one of the parts to use so an alternate parts list Unfortunately I've just realised that this as it stands won't work in my particular case with the strangely profiled 2020 as it won't accept T-nuts real printed or otherwise However I could use the same idea/principle to print some pseudo T-nuts that would fit the profile.Best to make it your own anyway Maybe customize it to you hole pattern That is one of the benefits I love about 3D printing you can make what you want rather than having to use with they make.Another option would be to purchase some 4mm x 5mm bar stock https www.mcmaster.com standard-aluminum-sheets and tap your own holes All you would need is a drill press https www.amazon.com/WEN-4208-8-Inch-Speed-Drill/dp/B00HQONFVE and an M3 Tap https www.amazon.com/Forsun-T-Handle-Ratchet-Wrench-Machine/dp/B01FTFX40S That would be as strong or stronger than someone else's

So we have a maximum segment length of 100/150 0.66 mm Now lats say our point field is 200 x 200 mm with 9 x 9 points So between 2 points we have 200 9-1 25 mm So we need at least 25 0.66 37 lines to move to the next measuring point So updating correction every 15 calls gives us at least 2 updates between the measured points NOTE Explicit z changes will always trigger an update define DISTORTION_UPDATE_FREQUENCY 15 Stepper ENABLE_BACKLASH_COMPENSATION As stated it is rarely needed so leave it set to 0 If you have a backlash in both z-directions you can use this For most printer the bed will be pushed down by it's own weight so this is nearly never needed define ENABLE_BACKLASH_COMPENSATION 0 ALLOW_QUADSTEPPING Do you need high frequencies This could be a case of leaving set to the default of 1 and if you experience stalling then set to 0 to see if it cures the stalling If you need frequencies off more then 30000 you definitely need to enable this If you have only 1/8 stepping enabling this may cause to stall your moves when 20000Hz is reached define ALLOW_QUADSTEPPING 1 Endstops ENDSTOP_PULLUP_X_MIN/ENDSTOP_X_MIN_INVERTING these are relatively easy From the comment for ENDSTOP_X_MIN_INVERTING By default all endstops are pulled up to HIGH You need a pull-up if you use a mechanical endstop connected with GND Set value to false for no pull-up on this endstop A pullup refers to a pull-up resistor This is in this case a piece of circuitry in the MicroController Unit MCU i.e the Arduino chip[ATmega 2560 on the controller board This define allows you to enable or disable it for each input connected to an endstop Basically they stop short circuits between the power supply and ground they do more than that but You probably need the MAX endstops enabled where you actually have an endstop If there are no MIN endstops i.e at the bottom of the rails then these can be set to false define ENDSTOP_PULLUP_X_MIN false define ENDSTOP_PULLUP_Y_MIN false define ENDSTOP_PULLUP_Z_MIN false define ENDSTOP_PULLUP_X_MAX true define ENDSTOP_PULLUP_Y_MAX true define ENDSTOP_PULLUP_Z_MAX true ENDSTOP_X_MIN_INVERTING this merely allows you to invert the input from the endstop For example if the endstop is triggered by a vertical carriage then the switch will close If instead the code is actually looking for an open switch rather than a closed switch when the endstop switch is being triggered by the vertical carriage hitting it then you simply need to invert it set to true to invert the logic of the endstops define ENDSTOP_X_MIN_INVERTING true define ENDSTOP_Y_MIN_INVERTING true define ENDSTOP_Z_MIN_INVERTING true define ENDSTOP_X_MAX_INVERTING false define ENDSTOP_Y_MAX_INVERTING false define ENDSTOP_Z_MAX_INVERTING false Fused Filament Fabrication EXTRUDER_SWITCH_XY_SPEED Probably best to leave as default 100 and tweak later if need be Speed in mm/s for extruder moves fom internal commands e.g switching extruder define EXTRUDER_SWITCH_XY_SPEED 100 With respect to the temperature sensor settings on the extruder read hotend from Repetier-Firmware Documentation define EXT0_TEMPSENSOR_TYPE 5 What temperature sensor are you using in the extruder The configuration file lists possible values and meanings define EXT0_TEMPSENSOR_PIN 0 This parameter is tricky and often causes wrong configurations For historical reasons it is named PIN but it IS NOT A PIN NUMBER It is the position in an array of analog input sources In this array the real pin number is stored In 99.9 0 is the correct answer here define EXT0_HEATER_PIN HEATER_0_PIN Which pin enables the heater block It works with any pin PWM capability is not required to use PID on an output For EXT0_TEMPSENSOR_TYPE the temperature sensor is buried inside the hotend heater block and as such it is probably not going to be easy nor desirable to remove and examine although it is certainly possible to do so if you feel up to the job If could be just a question of trial-and-error You have eight or so to choose from However the 100k thermistor is one of the most common types and so 1 would seem like a good setting to choose initially What type of sensor is used 0 is no thermistor/temperature control 1 is 100k thermistor Epcos B57560G0107F000 RepRap-Fab.org and many other 2 is 200k thermistor 3 is mendel-parts thermistor EPCOS G550 4 is 10k thermistor 8 is ATC Semitec 104GT-2 12 is 100k RS thermistor 198-961 13 is PT100 for E3D/Ultimaker 14 is 100K NTC 3950 5 is userdefined thermistor table 0 6 is userdefined thermistor table 1 7 is userdefined thermistor table 2 50 is userdefined thermistor table 0 for PTC thermistors 51 is userdefined thermistor table 0 for PTC thermistors 52 is userdefined thermistor table 0 for PTC thermistors 60 is AD8494 AD8495 AD8496 or AD8497 5mV/degC and 1/4 the price of AD595 but only MSOT_08 package 61 is AD8494 AD8495 AD8496 or AD8497 5mV/degC and 1.25 Vref offset like adafruit breakout 97 Generic thermistor table 1 98 Generic thermistor table 2 99 Generic thermistor table 3 100 is AD595 101 is MAX6675 102 is MAX31855 define EXT0_TEMPSENSOR_TYPE 1 As the Repetier documentation states in 99.9 of the cases for EXT0_TEMPSENSOR_PIN a value of 0 will probably work If it does not then you may need to change this to some other value For EXT0_HEATER_PIN HEATER_0_PIN just follow the wiring of your printer and see which pin the heater is connected to Where and how to change the settings You are probably aware of this already but in case you aren't Once you have downloaded Repetier-Firmware-master.zip from Github.com repetier/Repetier-Firmware and unzipped it then you will need to edit the files in Configuration.h in the src/ArduinoAVR/Repetier directory Note that the ArduinoAVR directory is used for the Arduino Mega 2560 board and its derivatives Open Repetier.ino in the Arduino IDE and edit Configuration.h in the Arduino IDE You could also edit Configuration.h in your favourite plain text editor if need be but it is probably easier and simpler to do everything in the Arduino IDE Once you have edited the settings that you require as I described in Help with Repetier firmware probably locked and licensed compile and upload the firmware to your board Then run a print If something seems to be incorrectly set stop the print Then re-tweak your settings ad compile and upload again and then run another test print Ad infinitum After a few iterations you should be quite comfortable with this process and end up with a well calibrated printer ",

        "comments": "still a small gap even if not visible in the print might make the 2 perimeters not join well together thus making the part less strong Also increasing the extrusion multiplier will result in more material extruded resulting in more weight so just using both infill and perimeters might result in a final part that is a little bit heavier but much stronger than a part with just the perimeters and a higher extrusion multiplier.You will always have a gap in the sliced rendering The gap is to distinguish one perimeter from another As noted in the answer what you see on the screen isn't what you'll get on the print bed Granted the zig-zag lines will likely be created as an infill but if the rendering shows two perimeters and no infill that's what will print The print settings will determine how well one perimeter joins another There are a number of 3D printed RC planes out there which means others have been successful If extreme light weight is your goal your tools may not be well chosen.Oh yeah it may be necessary to adjust your inside rib thickness in order to prevent infill and to turn that part of the model into perimeters but the original suggestion of experimentation applies Such changes would not likely be easily accomplished within the printer slicer settings as those changes apply to the entire model and not a particular segment If you have wing skins of 1.26 mm three perimeters should meet that specification but an inner rib of 1.00 mm will fail for the aforementioned reasons.Thanks for the explanation Now I have a better understanding of what you mean I will perform 1 or more small print tests and report the results.There is definitely a gap between the perimeters in the 3D print The render is accurate because I have already set the extruder width in Slic3r to match my printer's which is 0.4 mm Concentric infill works well for a cylinder but not for my wing design.What you're doing here is in effect asking for a 0.8mm wall thickness The other variable you can adjust is the extruder width you provide to cura so you might achieve 3 lines making 1mm but possibly with worse adhesion since you're under-extruding)",

        "answers": " You obviously do actually have a Z-probe but in case another user does not or you decide not to use yours I will cover both cases with and without a Z-probe Z-probe not present If not then in configuration.h set the FEATURE_Z_PROBE to false like this define FEATURE_Z_PROBE false or define FEATURE_Z_PROBE 0 Then you also need to set define DISTORTION_CORRECTION 0 as this requires the FEATURE_Z_PROBE if otherwise set to 1 or true However thereafter upon recompilation I then get a lot of other errors but these seem to be more to do with selecting the correct board define MOTHERBOARD in pins.h than the disabling of the Z-probe This error fastio.h:29 error DIOORIG_FAN2_PIN_WPORT was not declared in this scope is due to from Can't compile firmware You are using ORIG_FAN2_PIN in your configuration but apparently your boards pin definition does not define that pin In that case check board description and use the digital pin number instead for that function Actually that is not entirely true 1 NOTE It might be easier to just define Z_PROBE_PIN to something other than 1 which is what it is defaulting to as set in configuration.h define Z_PROBE_PIN 1 Z-probe present If you do have a Z-probe then trace the wires to see where they go on the controller board determine that pin number on the board and then enter that pin number into configuration.h For example if it is connected to pin 63 then define Z_PROBE_PIN 63 and leave DISTORTION_CORRECTION untouched Where to plug the Z-probe in If your Z-probe has become unplugged then you need to choose a pin to connect it to This is easy you simply connect it to any free pin Now you probably only have three end stops at the top of the delta frame These are the MAX end stops So you can simply connect the Z-probe to any of the three MIN end stop pins on the board Obviously you will leave the three define s for the MIN end stop in Configuration.h un-configured and then specify the pin that you did use in define Z_PROBE_PIN lt;your pin&gt See Is there a complete step by step manual for building Z probe comment 1950 Put the zprobe on any free pin you have but do NOT set it in endstops It is not a endstop it is a zprobe Then set it in zprobe section with pullup enabled so it is drawn to high internally until you connect the pin with gnd Then G31 should also be consistent I guess you missed the pullup part making it a random result and Is there a complete step by step manual for building Z probe Comment_1952 Not sure why this is a problem You have 6 endstop pins and need 3 for endstops 1 for zprobe 4 pins Still 2 endstop pins free When I said not in endstops I meant not in the endstop configuration There you only put switches that work as endstop Highlighting the connections The green PCB for the fan and Z-probe does not appear to have any logic on it I can't see any so it is just a collection of tracks i.e wires As there are no logic chips on it you can trace the circuit from the Z-probe to the controller either visually or using a multimeter set on continuity check I assume that the PCB is connected to the controller board somewhere/somehow Via the 10 wire grey ribbon cable that goes to the second green PCB next to the main board next to LED3 as shown in the first photo This ribbon cable transfers signals to/from the Z-probe/fan PCB to the secondary PCB which appears to be a power related PCB i.e heaters Somehow the secondary power PCB then connects to the main controller board One of the three unused MINIMUM end stop pins should be used for the Z-probe This is assuming that you only have three physical end stops at the top of the three axes and they are connected to the MAXIMUM end stop pins If you have six end stops one at the top and one at the bottom then that changes things drastically Assuming that you only have three then the three unused MINIMUM pins will be used for some other purposes Z-probe servo arm something else You need to confirm that you only have end stops at the top of the printer and not the bottom i.e only MAX_ENDSTOP or X Y and Z pins If so then you should have three sets of MIN_ENDSTOP pins with nothing connected to them in theory So one of those three MIN_ENDSTOP pins will have the Z-probe connected to it If you are having trouble locating the MIN_ENDSTOP pins trace where the 3 physical MAX end stops are connected to those will be the MAX_ENDSTOP pins Then from that the MIN_ENDSTOP pins should be relatively easy to identify Hopefully that makes sense Looking at the schema then it becomes obvious You see X X Y Y Z and Z The physical endstops should be connected to the three connectors The three connectors two of them are hopefully not connected The one that is should be the Z-probe Looking at the photo unfortunately it seems as if all six or just five are populated Personally to save time I would get a multimeter unplug the X Y Z connectors actually only the connectors in turn and test each one to see which is connected to the Z-probe To check the correct pin is used you really only have two sensible options either visually or multimeter Multimeter would be best and the most certain However there are two other options open to you one risky and one laborious As we have whittled it down to two connectors X-min and Z-min there are only two pins for the Z-probe and servo to worry about you only have a 50-50 chance of getting it wrong so you could guess code it up and see if it works if it doesn't then change the pin defined and recompile IMPORTANT After a rethink it is best not to just take the 50-50 chance as the servo pin is probably configured as an output and the Z-probe pin will be an input You could end up damaging the control board Finally you could in theory test it programmatically but that would require writing some test code for the controller which as we are having enough trouble as it is with the configuration.h file would be a nightmare to put it bluntly Schema Photo of control board It is probably a good idea to read this lengthly article Repetier Z-probing Footnotes 1 I have finally managed to get Repetier.ino to compile The problem lay with the Configuration.h file that came with the googledrive download that you provided Trying to either manually configure Configuration.h or pre-loading it into Repetier's configuration tool always resulted in the same compilation error see DIOORIG_FAN2_PIN_WPORT error The simplest solution is to create a Configuration.h file from new using the Configuration tool When you do that it will compile ok Or if you really want to do it manually either Set NUM_EXTRUDER to 1 and not 2 as the FAN2 compile error comes from the second extruder's set of define s or More precisely if you do have two extruders then change the line define EXT1_EXTRUDER_COOLER_PIN ORIG_FAN2_PIN and specify a pin i.e 65 en lieu of using ORIG_FAN2_PIN ",

        "answers": " This is easily explained it's the stepper motors getting powered up Stepper motors even if not moving are constantly powered up and actively hold the position they are in exactly at the stepping point where they are If you power down the machine or if the board disables the stepper drivers to save energy or because the power is offline then the stepper motors can get in between steps When powering on then the movement is quite noticeable on some cheaper motors where the inrushing current can kick the motor over multiple steps before it locks down into position You can test this try to move one of the axis manually by hand not too fast to not damage the board by providing it too much current if the printer is powered of it does move pretty easily Then power the printer on it should still move pretty easily by hand Now execute one move command on the axis via the printer board Afterwards you should not be able to move the axis by hand anymore or at least not without unnecessarily excessive force  I don't know details of your printer the motor drivers the firmware or the wiring harness I only have looked photos at the ANET-A8 Your question has ruled out a complex-axis movement caused by auto-leveling Printers that are not based on simple cartesian actuators such as delta or core-xy machines use multiple actuators to make what results in a simple single axis head movement Your printer is not based on one of these mechanisms but if the printer were temporarily misconfigured it may move unexpectedly On the hardware side some stepper drivers work with step and direction inputs If there is a problem with signal integrity on these signals as referenced to the stepper driver's ground you may be introducing an unintended step pulse Stepper drivers typically use pulse-width-modulation PWM to set the power through each of the two motor windings coils and generate noise that depends on too many factors to list Check that you have a direct ground wire from the stepper drivers to the controller board If the drivers are integral with the controller board one would hope the PCB was well designed It is possible the motion is caused by some force causing unpowered stepper motors to move although most unpowered motors will still have a bit of detent torque resisting motion This would require that Z-axis movement was causing some force on the other axes For the ANET-A8 the filament could apply side-to-side force to the extruder when moved up or down but it is difficult to see how it could cause front-to-back movement of the bed Your code may allow you to set the idle motor current as well as the active current If so you could try setting the idle current at say 80 of the idle current Your motors will be hotter when idle but should not overheat ",
        "comments": "What do you mean by several channels move together The X and Y axes also move when you move Z Are you perhaps seeing the effects of auto-bed leveling?How are you manually moving your printer Are you using some control software or writing in actual G-code commands?control software I've not tried using gcode directly since it's not been trivial to reproduce.If it is truly only the very first command my guess is that the micro doesn't boot up with clean buffers so the first execute the stack command reads whatever cruft is in there After that all the motor command stacks are properly reset.Dubious The odd behavour is not skipping a few steps its many mm of travel along the axes and persists for several seconds I've not determined if it only occurs when the steppers transition from disabled to move.Well one of the stepper motor cables in my CTC failed a while ago and had a bad connection It bumped the axis about 10cm along when it got powered up and then printed normally except for some erratic movement sometimes until the cable totally failed With new cables this only is about 1mm tops on the cheap motors and only noticeable as a slight shake and no move on my prusa with high quality motors But it's definitely there every time the steppers engage.But persisting over multiple seconds is strange it should only be one shake and subsequently slowing down movement.Why would cheaper motors suffer more from inrush current than expensive motors They're just some coils of wire and given the same resistance/reactance you're going to get the same inrush current.My guess is cheaper material on the coils higher resistance and a slower buildup of the magnetic field On the other hand it could as well be the cheaper stepper drivers that are overcurrenting or the wires not beeing beefy enough to handle the inrush on the cheaper machine so you're correct it's not necessarily the motors themselves But nonetheless on the cheaper built machine the movement from enabling steppers is extremely more pronounced.The idea of a bad mode configuration out of reset seems plausible It's not a problem just an oddity ",

        "comments": "Drawing it with OpenScad and some mathematics is one thing But printing it without support is an other big challenge!The question did not inquire about that aspect nor specify no support With an adequate base/brim it's probably do-able without further support by choice of helix angle but that would be printer/settings dependent Mind you a question of the utility of such a printed tube also crosses my mind but again not in the question.This is awesome I'll see if I can download OpenScad enter that code turn it into an stl The printing software I use XYZware Pro has the ability to add supports to stl objects I add in there so that might be okay Probably you'll also need to remove the supports from inside the tube Good luck with that.A picture and a snippet of OpenSCAD code doesn't really make an answer in my opinion Why not add textual some explanation of how the code actually works The question doesn't even focus on OpenSCAD in particular.Hey I'll be happy with what I get The inquiry was for any/all 3D printing software so includes OpenSCAD Of course I'd be happy for a more detailed inspection of what's going on but I realise you guys are taking time out of your days to answer for free which I appreciate.Although having just downloaded OpenSCAD the coil is a bit squashed so I'm still open to alternatives while I play around with some of the variables in OpenSCAD!Same thing works in Fusion 360Printed it out just now without supports in the orientation shown and it came out fine Used a brim though don't want it rolling away I would probably set fn=6 to turn it into a hexagon then make the gap between coils zero so that support material would not be needed.",

        "answers": " Have you checked the supply voltage With everything turned on steppers stepping laser on etc you may be pulling too much current and the supply voltage is drooping Use DVM to measure the DC voltage Also you will need to check for supply ripple For that either an oscilloscope or use DVM set for AC voltage  This is a stab in the dark but maybe the Arduino clone or genuine and RAMPS1.4 combination is not powerful enough to handle the calculations required to control the laser and printing simultaneously although I can't really see why the additional processing to control a laser would be over taxing the processor However your comment about slowing the printing seems to help alleviate the issue does back up the hypothesis I have read that the ATmega256 and lesser AVR microcontrollers can be working at its limits when controlling a 3D printer and having to deal with arcs or something that requires complex calculations Some printer control boards such as the Smoothie use different processors ARM in order to supersede these issues From 3D Printering Electronics boards The above boards use AVR microcontrollers While they work for what they\u2019re intended to do there are a few limitations Arcs and circles are a little weird to program and using these boards for something other than a cartesian 3D printer a CNC machine or a laser cutter for example is a bit out of the ordinary The Smoothie board\u00a0is the solution to these problems So if you have discounted power issues it could be due to computing power and it may be worth considering using a different more powerful controller  You should insert M400 commands before each and every M42 command The reason is that M42 skip the normal command queue Each M42 command is processed as soon as it is read and may be executed well before the G-code moves preceding it have actually been executed Inserting M400 before M42 will ensure that the printer finishes all moves before M42 changes the pin state The long streaks you're seeing correspond to the printer processing a laser-on command too early and the missed pulses correspond to processing a laser-off command too early  Thank you all for your suggestions and help It appears that I was just running the printer too fast and slowing it down to about 10 of my original speed fixed my problem I don't know where i got the rediculous speed from but 1200 mm/m is WAY too fast More like 150 to maybe 200 mm/m is what it should have been Oh well comes under the heading pay attention I guess  This is not an answer but a related question I'm assuming hoping that you are using Marlin to read the g-code What are you using to generate the g-code and how are you telling it that the fan control is really the laser control or are you manually editing the g-code Walt ",
        "comments": "Thank you Mark for responding Yes I did watch the power supply with a scope while a burn job was running and it is rock solid The supply is a 12V 20A switcher short 14 cable Malibu low voltage wire a 6 pin/10A Cinch-Jones connector between the supply and the printer 16 low current wiring and 14 heated bed wire not used for laser printing though To eliminate any possible unknowns I unplugged all the steppers and disconnected the laser diode I was able to fake the endstops as well and while scoping the PWM drive to the laser supply this problem still existed with no apparent change I even reduced the feedrate which slowed down the print speed and some of the problem improved but was still there at 50 I have ordered a REAL Arduino mega 2560 and will try that Another clue that might be related is I could never get the SD card working Checked all connections short cable between the display board with SD card and the RAMPS board read many forums and really went through the firmware and still couldn't read the card My processor board is an Iduino mega made by Geeetech so I know it is a clone and I was always suspicious of it The soldering isn't very good and I had to do some touch up when I got it.I know others aren't having this problem and I haven't gotten many responses probably due to my unique problem that others don't have I might try and scope the processor's power supply after the onboard regulator and see if it is clean Thank you again for your help and suggestion.What does the signal on the laser look like Also can you put your Marlin files somewhere I/we can see them?I will reconnect the board and get some waveforms for you I took a chance and ordered a real Arduino Mega 2560 rather than a clone although I am somewhat doubtful that this will fix it Which Marlin files would you like to look at as there are quite a few I have a dropbox account that I can post my scope traces to and upload the Marlin files that you would like to look at BTW I did more investigating and noticed that when Repetier sends commands to the printer the printer pauses for about 250 mseconds while it processes the comman This is where the problems occur.I had to slow the feedrate down to about 10 to see this but it was there and the laser pulse was also delayed/skipped/stretched when it happened hhmmmm a clue This is what prompted me to purchase the Mega as a stab in the dark that maybe the clone is having problems processing the data from my computer Also I have never been able to us my SD card so possibly a related problem don't really know YET@Pomonaill220 Stock Marlin files are at https github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin I would like to see the files that are not stock your config)@Pomonaill220 there are a LOT of overlapping features on Marlin It is really easy to get the config setup so that more than one thing is controlling the same output.Here is my dropbox link to two captures that I just got The first one is the D6 output from my RAMPS board at 75 power and the second one is while I was running a job with the same output and power I don't get the skips very often so I had to perform multiple single shots on my scope but I did get a good one The picture title is the G code that I sent to the printer Notice the missing pulses.Ok I will upload config.h as that is the one that has been modified.oopss guess you need the dropbox link huh!here it is:https www.dropbox.com/sh/t14inwpd2vrq8wi/AAD6fFXeNXNYmeBPY_REHLKSa?dl=0The time where the pulses are missing is where the printer is receiving data commands from the computer A few times the pulses actually stayed on but I couldn't capture that for some reason.I kinda thought that also but wouldn't running an extruder in the 3D printer mode with the extruder stepper X,Y and Z axis all running a coling fan and both the extruder heater and heated bed use more processor power than modulating one pwm pin and only the X stepper Unless there is more going on for the laser than running the filament in 3D mode I can't see that although there may be something that I am not seeing Also the original printerboard was ALOT less powerful than the Arduino and it worked for the 3D printer Others are using the same setup for a laser and it works.I appreciate your input and thoughts believe me That is where two or more minds are alot better at solving problems Thank you for your input I have seen similar posts about the arc/circle being a tough thing for these 8 bit boards as well Only thing is using a laser I am not cutting arcs/circles Straight X travel and laser on/off during travel.I am heading towards this clone not handling communications correctly because of the pause when receiving data from the computer Can't imagine why this would be different from clone to real board though unless there is problem with parts We'll get to the bottom of this I don't give up easily AND I appreciate ALL the help I am getting too Thank You.Another brainstorm thought I will try and get more scope pictures showing USB comm and laser drive to see if the two are related I will post them on my dropbox and let you guys know.AHHA I will give that a try Thank You IF I use the fan pin D9 and the M106 to turn the laser on would inserting the M400 before the M106 work as well I could add that to my laser on and M107 for laser off Example M400 M106 S120 for 120 power and M400 M107 I'll give it a try and see what happens Thanks again!Well the format of the commands didn't work the laser never turned on Soooo I will have to add the M400 before each laser command on a separate line darn it!@Pomonaill220 Are you aware that only the negative side of the fan is switched The positive terminal is always at 12V.Yes I am aware of how the fan output is driven y the FET thanks for the note though What I think my WHOLE problem is is that I am trying to make all my moves too fast I had the burn speed set at 1200 mm/min and non burn speed at 4500 mm/min I slowed it WAY down to 150 mm/min and non burn to 4000 mm/min Never skipped a beat I think I might try seeing just how fast I can go before missing commands but I did research and some are running at 60 mm/min NOT 1200 I'll give it a try just to see A little too enthusiastic I think huh?In almost all cases only one M code is allowed per data block this is true for Fanuc controllers and likely applies to 3D printers as they copied most of the standard You can have multiple G code per block though.@Pomonaill220 You might be able to make a self-answer to this question if the problem

        "answers": " I'll take a stab here but my gut instinct is to say that a printed part will not sound the same as your original gourd resonator I believe the acoustics rely on the hardness shape and size of the material In which case a gourd is a hard and often thin material after gutting it Typical 3D printing materials will have a minimum thickness which may get in the way of achieving the same shape of the gourd resonator and plastics are typically going to be softer in hardness than your gourd So in short I think if your try to replicate the resonator with 3D printing it will not sound the same That may not be a bad thing depending on what you're looking for Also who's to say the resonator has to be shaped like that 3D printers allow us to manufacture parts that have historically been impossible to make and many instruments that we use today were designed hundreds of years ago with far less advanced tools available I say its worth trying a replica of the gourd and then exploring other shapes to print that may affect the tonality of your instrument  I can't answer this from a technical 3D printing angle But from a musical angle Where the body of an instrument has the primary function of enclosing a vibrating air column the material has often been demonstrated to perhaps make a difference but only a subtle one As an example a recent range of plastic trombones although not first-class instruments have proved extremely playable and have the great advantage of being virtually indestructable I suggest you try this Play your instrument dampening vibration of the caba\u00e7a with your hand or with a piece of cloth Just damp the shell externally Don't obstruct the hole or put anything inside Now fill the caba\u00e7a with cotton wool or similar If the first makes little difference you're probably good to go with a plastic caba\u00e7a Of course if the second makes little difference either we might have to suspect that the caba\u00e7a is mainly decorative You could also experiment with alternative resonators of a similar size and capacity available off the shelf not worrying too much about a cosmetic match They might sound even better  Here is a great answer to the underlying physics of resonance A object rings because it has acquired energy in a way that it resonates it vibrates at a frequency and with enough energy to generate sound waves As long as the object has sufficient energy it will continue to ring It cannot ring forever as the sound waves gradually reduce the amount of energy that the object has But generating sound waves not the only way that an object can lose energy One of the ways that plastics differ from metals is that plastics are better able than metals to dissipate energy internally Any plastic object will show some amount of viscosity dampening since all polymeric materials have a non-zero loss modulus curve Metals can also have internal dissipation mechanisms but they are far less prevalent than in plastics So we all know it you can make plastic musical toys They never resonate as well as metal glass or wood but they often can work Here is an example of a Trumpet made out of ABS This plastic's magazine also makes it's pitch for using plastics in musical instruments most of which is also ABS That said if Young's Modulus is the key as the first comment said PLA should be even better as its Young's Modulus is a bit larger than ABS All that said all the plastic bells I have seen are generally pretty quiet Plastic has a habit of absorbing energy and thus not being a very good resonator If you want to try I think you are going to have to find a way to harden the plastic Maybe Acetone treated PLA as that seems to harden it Maybe try something simple like printing a plastic bell If you can get that to ring you are well on your well  Of course I've printed a 7 octave organ rank so it's certainly possible Organ pipes are quite special in that the material properties of the pipe play a secondary role in the tone the primary role being played by the length of the pipe and the elements surrounding the mouth of the pipe It's also well understood how the pipe material properties affect the sound so it's possible to design the printed pipe to mimic properties of either a wooden or a metal pipe and anything in between Depending on how big of a role the resonator's stiffness plays in the sound of the instrument you might need to replicate some of mechanical properties of the Gourd shell e.g its stiffness in the printed shape Thus the inside of the print will have the shape of the inside of a Gourd but the exterior may need to be much farther away and then the infill percentage will play an important role as well as the infill shape The shape of the interior of the gourd can be approximated by measuring some dimensions and sculpting an interior surface in a 3D modeler or CAD Most likely a 3D scan is not necessary unless you can get it done cheaply and with no fuss You will also need to print full-size instruments So this will not be cheap in terms of material used and printer time I would benchmark the printed instrument at 3 shell thicknesses 0.5 1.0 and 1.5 inches and 3 infill percentages 20 35 50 All with 3 perimeter layers and cubic infill The thick 1.5in shell with high infill will be the stiffest of them all ",

        "answers": " Perhaps the culprit is a pull-up resistor on the board Normally endstops on 3D printers use the microcontroller's internal pullups These have a resistance of around 50k\u03a9 which is far too high to be a problem However if lower value pull up resistors are used on your main board this could cause a problem The resistor of your voltage divider form when the output of the sensor is low a parallel pair of resistors to ground with an effective resistance equal to 1 1/10+1/15 6k\u03a9 If there was let's say a 4.7k pull-up resistor on the board you'd expect to see around 2.8V on the output because the pull-up resistor together with the two resistors of your voltage divider forms another voltage divider I don't have the Anet A8 main board myself but on pictures I do see a set of 6 resistors suspiciously close to the thermistor and endstop connectors You could verify my suspicions by unplugging the endstop powering down the electronics and then measuring the resistance between the endstop signal and 5V pins Possible solutions Desolder the offending resistor This is pretty easy with SMD parts you just alternate between heating up both sides until it slides off Use a diode in place of a voltage divider Anode goes to the endstop connector cathode to the signal of the probe This prevents the high voltage of the probe from being seen by the electronics while allowing the probe to drain the current from the pull-up resistor With this last solution make sure the reverse leakage current of the diode is not too high If it has a reverse current of let's say 50uA then 50uA flowing through the supposed 4.7k pull-up to ground would raise the voltage at the signal pin to 5.002V This is unlikely to be a problem but with higher value resistors or higher leakage you'd see the voltage raise higher above 5V which the microcontroller won't like ",
        "comments": "Thank you very much I will try to verify if it is in fact due to the pull-up resistor If that is indeed the culprit I will try to install the diode as you suggested If not I will try an optocoupler Thank you very much Also very nice to see a fellow puzzle designer answer my question ",

        "body": " Today I installed an inductive sensor 4 mm sensing distance NPN on my printer to perform auto-bed leveling The sensor works at 12 V and the board at 5 V so I used a voltage divider as suggested in many places online using a 10kOhm and a 15kOhm resistor In testing the sensor I noticed that the sensor's LED turns on but the printer Anet A8 doesn't recognize the fact that the sensor is triggering I'm running the Skynet3D firmware though I still have not switched to the version with auto bed-leveling Regardless the inductive sensor should still act as a limit switch yet the Z-Axis motor does not stop when the sensor triggers Am I doing something wrong or missing a step I have also measured the voltage across the leads that connect to the board and the voltage is slightly over 5 V when the sensor is not triggered and lowers to around 2.5 V when the sensor triggers I get the feeling it should be closer to 0 V Thank you very much for any help ",

        "answers": " I don't know if I understood your question properly You using the mold to create a rubber stamp and then you use that to stamp over stuff If so you simply can use 3D printing to create the stamp if not my answer is rubbish You can use a flex material to create the stamp itself and then use some hard material to create the handle Also you can create a mold around the stamp and use resin to fill it and/or create a resin mold and then use that mold to create the stamps by filling the holes with more resin  This would likely not work ABS has a glass transition temperature of 105C It doesn't have a melting point because it's amorphous Rather as you heat the part up it gradually transitions from a solid to a viscous liquid but there is no hard transition from solid to molten at one particular temperature The glass transition temperature at 105C is significantly lower than the 200C melting point of ABS you quoted At 160C while ABS would not be molten sufficiently for 3D printing it definitely becomes flexible and would deform easily I do not think it would hold its shape very well over the long period of time it has to spend in your vulcanizing machine under high pressure and well above its glass transition temperature The surface of 3D printed objects also usually has a somewhat rough finish If you wanted to make satisfactory stamps you would probably need to spend a long time manually finishing the 3D printed master before making a mold from it ",
        "comments": "\"SLA is a printing process It doesn't have a melting point.Having done this form of rubber stamp creation in high school so many decades ago I like to see that it's still around Consider to use a hobby-grade CNC machine for your metal masters rather than a 3D printer I expect you could use aluminum for the block rather than magnesium although the wear factor would be higher If 3D printing is still the focus also research nylon SLS printing Nylon melting point is 200\u00b0C but I don't know if it has a glass transition temperature.The mold is used to create the same image multiple times the product I am selling is the rubber stamp image itself for consumers to use for their own creative uses.I wasn't sure which material would be best use so apparently the ABS is out possibly using PLA might work or if the temperature is still iffy maybe a metal/PLA hybrid would do the trick I'm not too worried about the possibly rough finish of the 3D object since what I am wanting to do is to make a 3D relief object from a 2D artwork image The only part that is important is for the top surface of the 3D item to be smooth that would be the artwork image part which would then be used to make the mold Buffing out the sidewalls could be done with a Dremel if needed Thanks.I meant PLA still getting used to the terminology sorry A hobby grade CNC is still pretty damn expensive my son has a new 3D printer so the experiment here is to see if a plastic master can be made if it will in fact work in the vulcanizer and if so then look into purchasing a machine for my own uses Whether it is PLA ABS Nylon or a PLA/metal hybrid whatever works best would be of interest I just read a little on glass transition I'm not sure it would be an issue for what I'm trying to do My use of the master shouldn't have any movement other then vertical maybe an issue.",

        "body": " I am an art rubber stamp maker using a vulcanizer to make art rubber stamps from molds that are usually created with a magnesium plate The normal process is to send artwork off to an engraving firm to acid etch the magnesium plate 11 pt depth is desired and that metal plate is then used with uncured matrix boards a bakelight type material that is cured in the vulcanizer that is then used over and over to make as many images of the rubber stamps as one would want The vulcanizer heats up to 300 to 320 degrees F and one usually uses 2000 to 2500 p.s.i of pressure for 10 to 15 minutes to cure a mold Once the mold is cured it is impervious to the heat used in the vulcanizer and the heat is used to cure the unvulcanized rubber again 300 or so degrees 2000 psi or so for 8 to 10 minutes In reading up about the melting points of SLA and ABS the 200C equates to around 460F so there doesn't seem like the heat of the vulcanizer will be an issue and the pressure isn't applied all at once one usually allows the uncured matrix board to heat up before the high pressure is obtained I'm just curious if any other stamp makers have had success with this method and/or have any suggestions about STL files for this type of printing if there needs to be 2 or 3 degree shoulder angle added to the file configuration or any other suggestions Thanks in advance ",
